He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Ch\u00e1vez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",
