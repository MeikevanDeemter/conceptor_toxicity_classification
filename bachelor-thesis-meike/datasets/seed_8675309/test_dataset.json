And why do 99% of school/village discussions have something along the lines of 'villages are automatically notable' example: Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Blathur? Is there no precedent for deletion but only for keeping? I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm just curious. I'm not a fan of precedent for the sake of precedent because, like consensus, it can change over time but I'm not sure where to fin d the answer. Hope you're having a good weekend",
