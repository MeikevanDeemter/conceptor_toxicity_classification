This refers to the excessive number of non-free fair-use images in the article. As per the non-free guidelines the usage of excessive images is to be reduced and to be limited as much as possible. Most of these images carry Shahid and Kareena's images and hence 6 images is far too high. I was hoping to discuss this with you before removing them from the article page. Also I hope that you don't mind me doing quick checks for MOS consistency and additional info.   \n\n==",

I agree that it remains unclear, but I think saying so in the article may be more opinion and conjecture than anything else.  If we had a source saying the same thing it would be different, but as it stands it is just an opinion bit.  I seem to recall something at the time that talked about his being put in ADX because it is the only Fed prison, since Marion was downed, to provide security.  Weren't there a number of threats and beliefs that Farstow would be hurt or worse if he was left in general population?",

If the article were recreated, it would quickly be nominated for deletion, and I would strongly recommend deletion for the reasons I mentioned above.\n\nI would suggest you present the No Original Research guideline to your professor and explain that there are limits on what you can publish to Wikipedia; he should be able to find an alternate venue for you to publish your findings.

As soon as one person said on the phone that Everton were always the Catholic club, you'd get twenty people phoning in to say they were the Protestant club. It's such a fervent debate that there's really just not the space it needs on the Wikipedia entry, and surely the fact that there's even a debate shows that the religious affiliations of the two clubs aren't as ingrained in their existence as those of Rangers and Celtic - as such, I don't think it's necessary to include it.  14:47",

The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate.

Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the \"\"Personal life\"\" section of his dad's article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon). The alternative would be to create a stub article which basically has just one or two lines of text, including a link tothe Legion (demon).
