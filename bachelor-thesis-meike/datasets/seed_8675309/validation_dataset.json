I just hope that people become more judicious about this...\nOh, and finally, libel against a public figure requires \"\"reckless indifference to the truth\"\" or \"\"knowledge that the statement was false.\"\"  I don't see anything here that suggests there was any libel.\"",

Republican China, for example, we agreed to point to History of the ROC since it is most appropriate for someone looking for something about .

They knew the genes were in the chromosomes and that they could be reshuffled by crossover, exchanging parts of chromosomes. If crossover recombination had created a new gene, I think they would have registered that as mutation. That is the mindset in which I think this statement should be interpreted.

Sames was 81 years old at the time, and living in San Antonio. I have a copy of the article, but not the date, which I'm guessing was from the mid to late 1990's.
