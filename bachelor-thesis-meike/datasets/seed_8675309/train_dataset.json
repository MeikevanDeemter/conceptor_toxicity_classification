He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Ch\u00e1vez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

What about some \"\"motorized rifle\"\" (a term mentioned deep in the article by one of the authors)? So why don't we develop this issue? If you're OK with that, let's put our findings on the article's talkpage. Cheers,  \"",

Agreed, when Dutch \"\"try\"\" to speak English they may use it, but that does not mean this implies anything but incomplete mastery of the English language. On the other hand, the Dutch also use England for the whole of the UK, both in Dutch (Engeland) as in English. \n There has been a short period in history only when Holland was official shorthand, that was in the time of the Kingdom of Holland (about 10 year in Napoleontic times); but I think a vassal state created by a conquering army can hardly be an argument that there is a history of \"\"legitimate\"\" or \"\"formal\"\" shorthand.   16:42, 11\"",

I don't think his argument is at all valid, but in the course of looking stuff up on the web I've discovered that some fans of the movie apparently consider the SG-1 series to be somehow illegitimate or non-canon. I'm not familiar with the Stargate fan community, just the show itself, so I don't feel comfortable adding discussion of this directly to the article.

The Historical Association apparently updates some of its older pamphlets occasionally, and it could well have done so with its Common Errors in History (although I have no evidence for that, other than Russell's description itself).  I did try browsing through the Australian National Library's collection of the  Historical Association's later pamphlets without finding anything else relevant.  But since the National Library's collection is incomplete, that doesn't mean very much.\nIt might be worth contacting the Historical Association itself to see if they can provide any further information.\n\u2014\u00a0(talk\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0cont)",

In April 2003 a Netherlands-based academic institution, Heidelberg Appeal the Netherlands, examined the judgment. It found that there were 27 accusations against Lomborg, of which only two minor ones might be justified. Meanwhile, Lomborg had lodged a formal complaint against the Danish Committee, and in December the Danish government overturned the committee's ruling. UCS is also no recognised academic body.

Also, in answer to RichardVeryard's concerns about internet petitions, the one in question is hosted and maintained by the UK government, and the results are passed directly to the Prime Minister. All signatures are validated with a full UK address, presumably to be verified against the electoral register.

(All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance). I sincerely hope this page will be around in some form in another hundred years, at which point homophobia will no longer be a neologism.

Following some sort of makeshift standard is desirable when it comes to the colour schemes on television seasons because it keeps petty arguments and debates from arising, similar to the ones above.

    "text": "2nd Army or 4th Army? \n\nSo I've been slowly eating through Barbarossa Derailed: Battle of Smolensk, Volume 2 (by D. Glantz) and it consistently states that Army Group Centre (specifically as of August and September 1941) was made up of 9th Army, 2nd Army, 2nd Panzer Group (or Army Group Guderian or Panzer Group Guderian), 3rd Panzer Group, and some other secondary Armies. It never mentions of 4th Army, as far as I have read or glanced through. Several Wikipedia articles all agree 4th Army was there. I'm baffled. Not sure, which it is anymore. Glantz or the many Wikipedia articles? Can some other editor dig into this and make any needed changes.",

Determining this will often involve original research and interpretation.\nNo, if you go by the inclusion criteria given in the lead of this list: this journal clearly is not \"\"focused\"\" on environmental issues, even though they may be included in the scope.\nNo, if you go by the journal's homepage, which not even mentions the word \"\"environmental\"\".\nSo it all depends on how you want to define \"\"environmental journal\"\". Personally, I would define that as a journal dedicated to environmental issues, not just any journal that occasionally also publishes something related. But I also know that David tends to go for the latter, wider definition -)   \"",

As soon as one person said on the phone that Everton were always the Catholic club, you'd get twenty people phoning in to say they were the Protestant club. It's such a fervent debate that there's really just not the space it needs on the Wikipedia entry, and surely the fact that there's even a debate shows that the religious affiliations of the two clubs aren't as ingrained in their existence as those of Rangers and Celtic - as such, I don't think it's necessary to include it.  14:47",

The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate.

Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the \"\"Personal life\"\" section of his dad's article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon). The alternative would be to create a stub article which basically has just one or two lines of text, including a link tothe Legion (demon).

I settled on a Boss Loop Station instead, rather than a Headrush or Boomerang, due to those two's reliability & price issues, respectively. Check out Hovercraft, Southpacific, & Auburn Lull if you're into this kind of hallucinitory guitar looping.

My own experience is, of course, anecdotal. But the results were little short of astonishing.
