We're all too stupid to figure out what the actual ad means. We need ABC to break it down for us. Save it. You have an agenda and you won't let anyone interfere with it.

It means \"\"a white American of Italian descent.\"\" Russian-American \"\"a white American of Russian descent.\"\" Irish-American \"\"a white American of Irish descent.\"\" What about Asian-American? I don't see you people questioning those ethnic terms. I think you're all racist. I have no problem with the use of the term black American or black. I just know they're not real ethnic or racial designations because black is a skin color. Most people in India are black-skinned. Most Australian Aborigines are black-skinned. Does it mean they're of African ancestry? No.   \"",

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

I must of hit a nerve with some \"\"idiots\"\" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!\"",

And in the translated book of memories, Silent Hill Hiroyuki Owaku stated that Cybil's fate is \"\"left to players' imaginations\"\".\n\nAlso, SH4 revealed that SH2 protagonist James Sunderland disappeared when he went to Silent Hill. Does that mean he died too? NO, not at all.\n\nPLEASE pay attention when you play video games. \n\nThank you. ;)\"",

So for example Timur seems to hve been very brutal, as you state, and yet adopted some Persian customs.  So did slavery under his reign mean there was slavery in Iran?

What is interesting is the question of \"\"what are the Roma (Gypsies/\u03a4\u03c3\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9)?\"\" According to the Greek government again, they number about 200,000 - are they included in the ethnic Greeks figure? According to official statistics again (1991 census), the Thrace minority is 0.98% of the total population at that time (about 28.8% of the total population of Thace at that time).

The debates on product lifespans, articulated through the theory of emotionally durable design tickly important here. Professor Chapman's work in this area therefore provides an excellent example of how to deal with sustainability issues, through the disciplines of product design and industrial design, and it's importanthis work is featured on these page. Perhaps remove reference to him, but leave all references to the theory of emotionally durable design, and the supporting contextual statement? Thanks",

People are prone to arguing that a given xkcd strip provides some unique insight into a subject when this is usually extremely subjective. Were this actually the case for a given reference then one would imagine that some third party would pick up on this in a reliable source.

In the siphon, if your pipe is large and there is no jet, then there will be no flying droplets. You need either the water to be travelling at a reasonably speed if there is no jet, or you can have a large tube and slow speed if you fit a jet, however, as noted above, pressure energy is converted to velocity head energy as it travels through the jet, with the smaller jet size giving it the speed necessary.\n\nSo the answer to what makes the droplets fly through the air is velocity head energy.",

I would like to help by adding pronunciations as opposed to just adding the templates, but I don't know how to find out the pronuncations (like for 'Ewa Beach) or how to transcribe them into IPA. Thanks! Iamunknown \n\n I learnt IPA during phonetics courses at university.  If you want to learn IPA then a course is probably the best plan, but otherwise there are books as well as  articles and exercises on the internet (including wikipedia).  It is worth training yourself to really listen and feel words a bit, as it is so easy to get misled by the spelling in English.  I hope this helps.",

It is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals I know, whether published by the ACS, the RCS, Elsevier, or Wiley. In my opinion, the reason is that once you go beyond benzene and start to look at heterocycles, polycyclic aromatic molecules, reactive intermediates, and reaction mechanisms, the Kekule notation makes electron counting and \"\"electron pushing\"\" much more straightforward. The circle notation only seems to be common for some organometallic compounds such as ferrocene and some aromatic ions such as the cyclopentadienyl anion and the tropylium cation.   \"",

This is not disputed by the UN or the international community. In addition, Israel is in violation of UN resolution 242, the 2002 UN , on Torture, as well as other well documented human rights abuses. To not mention these at all and to just point the finger at the Palestinians for violating international law does a great disservice to this article and makes it have a very biased POV.

The SFA answer: \u201d the\u2026policy relates to applications for a new membership. In this case, Rangers Newco will be applying for the transfer of an existing membership held with the Oldco. Rangers Oldco submitted the necessary financial information for 2009 and 2010. It did not submit for the year 2011, which resulted in the Judicial Panel sanctioning the club a total of \u00a3160,000 for various breaches of its Articles of Association, and also imposing a transfer embargo which has been subsequently set aside after the Court of Session ruling by Lord Glennie.\u201d That is \u2013 transferring old to new is not the same as a new club pitching up and wanting in. . Hopefully it will all be sorted soon.",

The article states that it seems to require 5 colors, presumably because the grey area cannot simply be colored red, yellow or blue without re-coloring. However, it *can* be colored green, and that doesn't require shuffling any of the other colors around. This makes it a very misleading counterexample. I know I spent a lot of time scratching my head wondering why this was considered a counter-example at all, and how the caption made any sense. Please either replace it with an example which does need to be re-colored in order to work or remove it (not that I don't think it's a valiant attempt, but it's just confusing).

The video is not verified as authentic.  I've seen it, and it appears to be highly edited, which could drastically affect its authenticity.  Jagex has acknowledged and fixed the problem.  The coincidence that it happened on a specific date is just that, coincidence.  No one but the vandals who keep changing the article calls it the 666 massacre.  That's just silly.  Get over it and let it go.  It is not significant to RuneScape or to anyone over the age of 14.",

Modern science is essentially empirical - it makes experiments and observations.  Theories and principles are secondary and must follow these results whither they lead, whether they make sense or not.  In medicine, simple mechanistic ideas do not suffice to explain many observations.  For example, if you give someone an emetic in a certain way then it is found to have the opposite effect of preventing nausea.  It seems that the doctor-patient relationship plays a considerable part in this and it may be that homeopathy is especially efficacious in this regard.

I'm very sceptical of such purported discoveries. I mean, 8,000 kilometers (about 5,300 miles) is a lot of mileage for only three and a half years. I can't think of an expedition that would compare (didn't Poyarkov travel a few thousand miles in about the same time period?). Pyanda reminds me of Juan de Fuca: someone who commanded an expedition that supposedly accomplished quite a bit by a person that actually existed, but was recorded years after the fact (Fuca's three decades to Pyanda's century), with little or no primary documents supporting any of the discoveries. Shouldn't we be more cautious in reporting his (perhaps) fictional expedition?",

For me, that's a bone of contention.  Editors are not required to preserve content, so if that's something he wants to do, he needs to do it himself.",

Thus, it criminalizes attacks on other people's computers. It has nothing to do with protecting copyright-holders from unauthorized access performed by a user on his own computer. Therefore, the example of the music CD is right off-target. Indeed, the CMA probably affords protection in the opposite direction - Sony's CD rootkit DRM could well be illegal under the CMA.",

I did try browsing through the Australian National Library's collection of the  Historical Association's later pamphlets without finding anything else relevant.

That stops people gaining accessed to WMF-held archives of the list, but it does nothing about personal copies of mailing list correspondence kept by individual arbitrators. There are some arbitrators who have been on the committee for years (much longer than I was), and if archives are purged then any personal archives they may hold would be the next logical target. There are ways to make that attack vector less vulnerable, though, and purging the archives would ensure that new arbitrators only have access to what they get while on the committee. So on balance, I think purging of the archives is something that should, and likely will, be done. Trouble is, it looks like it is a bit late now, and it also raises the problem of verifying the leaks.
