You mean ottoman empire requested different things from armenians as compared to turks? A facist request? What about raping turkish woman they were also woman there were no difference. These kind of things are happening in all war in history and nobody knows if it is true. You mean that turks were facist and hating armenians and raped them?

(You might like to take a look at the edit history there.) For the rest, Enescu was not an ethnomusicologist (as Bart\u00f3k and Kodl\u00e1ly were), and so it would be unreasonable to expect from him a deep knowledge of the rural folk music music of his country. It is also frequently observed that he \"\"absorbed\"\" folk elements into his compositional style, rather than actually quoting folksongs\u2014with a few exceptions, mainly the two Romanian Rhapsodies.

I have to say I was very impressed that although a small number of the responses I got were perhaps merely provocative, much of what people said was very civil, intelligent and reasonable, and continued to be so despite my minority of about one!
