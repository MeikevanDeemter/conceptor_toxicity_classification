I thought with it being in the withdrawal section people realise that it was referring to people withdrawing or withdrawn and recovering from benzos. It is not about the risks of mixing benzos and alcohol and enhanced side effects but is talking about replacing one cross tolerant drug with another cross tolerant drug, they work similarly in the brain so basically drinking alcohol is like staying on benzos and worse because alcohol is more toxic.

I agree that, per the BLP page, this could fall under its purview to a small extent. My concern would be that someone in the future starts making sweeping changes (read: deletions) based on IDONTLIKEIT with the BLP as their smokescreen justification.

People are prone to arguing that a given xkcd strip provides some unique insight into a subject when this is usually extremely subjective.

It is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals I know, whether published by the ACS, the RCS, Elsevier, or Wiley.

    "text": "I agree that the section on Israel/Palestine is biased towards the Israeli point of view. By construting Israeli settlements on Palestinian land, Israel is in violation of Article 49, paragraph 6 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibit the occupying power from transfering its own civilians to occupied territory. This is not disputed by the UN or the international community. In addition, Israel is in violation of UN resolution 242, the 2002 UN , on Torture, as well as other well documented human rights abuses. To not mention these at all and to just point the finger at the Palestinians for violating international law does a great disservice to this article and makes it have a very biased POV. I believe wikipedia can rise above the massive POV of the U.S. media which refuses to criticize Israel for any reason whatsoever. We need more people to look at this article and to stop reverting it to an Israeli/American POV.",

I know I spent a lot of time scratching my head wondering why this was considered a counter-example at all, and how the caption made any sense.

The video is not verified as authentic.  I've seen it, and it appears to be highly edited, which could drastically affect its authenticity.  Jagex has acknowledged and fixed the problem.  The coincidence that it happened on a specific date is just that, coincidence.  No one but the vandals who keep changing the article calls it the 666 massacre.  That's just silly.

    "text": ", 2 July 2008 (UTC)\n Talk of scientific principles is pseudoscience which was discarded in the Renaissance.  Modern science is essentially empirical - it makes experiments and observations.  Theories and principles are secondary and must follow these results whither they lead, whether they make sense or not.  In medicine, simple mechanistic ideas do not suffice to explain many observations.  For example, if you give someone an emetic in a certain way then it is found to have the opposite effect of preventing nausea.  It seems that the doctor-patient relationship plays a considerable part in this and it may be that homeopathy is especially efficacious in this regard.  Our lede should not be dogmatic when the matter is not fully understood.   13:06",

Jessie Burton's best selling novel was a fine debut, but I did think she wasn't quite up the task right now. You might enjoy it. The Warmoesstraat is an English Wikipedia article in need of rescue .\n\nNothing personal about that image of your. Fine little chap and I congratulate you. But there's another or so 100+ coming on line every minute, so you may have some competition there. I'll let you off myself. It is curious that when you make a Google search for free to use even commercially images of new born baby boys, there really isn't anything more suitable. Cheers.",

I can't think of an expedition that would compare (didn't Poyarkov travel a few thousand miles in about the same time period?). Pyanda reminds me of Juan de Fuca: someone who commanded an expedition that supposedly accomplished quite a bit by a person that actually existed, but was recorded years after the fact (Fuca's three decades to Pyanda's century), with little or no primary documents supporting any of the discoveries. Shouldn't we be more cautious in reporting his (perhaps) fictional expedition?",

That stops people gaining accessed to WMF-held archives of the list, but it does nothing about personal copies of mailing list correspondence kept by individual arbitrators. There are some arbitrators who have been on the committee for years (much longer than I was), and if archives are purged then any personal archives they may hold would be the next logical target. There are ways to make that attack vector less vulnerable, though, and purging the archives would ensure that new arbitrators only have access to what they get while on the committee. So on balance, I think purging of the archives is something that should, and likely will, be done. Trouble is, it looks like it is a bit late now, and it also raises the problem of verifying the leaks. How can you verify that a \"\"leak\"\" is genuine if the mastercopy has been destroyed?   \n\n\"",
