Consensus is a decision or resolution that all parties in a dispute or discussion can accept, even if they disagree.  Please take care to note the difference.  In day to day matters, such as VfD and RFA, a supermajority serves as a practical substitute for real consensus.  However, such operational conveniences do not change the proper definition of consensus.   \n\n Jimbo's decision forced a consensus that was probably already developing, but had clearly not been reached at the time he announced his opinion.  Regardless of its history, it's now a fact of Wikipedia life that virtually everyone accepts, and I don't intend to argue it further.   \"",
