It's not a reliable source because it is biased, and the no original research policy is a dumb policy. Why would you not want to see the actual ad for yourself? Oh, I know. We're all too stupid to figure out what the actual ad means. We need ABC to break it down for us. Save it. You have an agenda and you won't let anyone interfere with it.

The term African American means \"\"a black American of African descent; a black person descendant of African slaves that were victims of American slavery.\"\" It doesn't mean we're technically African. And it does not apply to black immigrants from the Carribean or anywhere else. What about Italian-American? It means \"\"a white American of Italian descent.\"\" Russian-American \"\"a white American of Russian descent.\"\" Irish-American \"\"a white American of Irish descent.\"\" What about Asian-American? I don't see you people questioning those ethnic terms. I think you're all racist. I have no problem with the use of the term black American or black. I just know they're not real ethnic or racial designations because black is a skin color. Most people in India are black-skinned. Most Australian Aborigines are black-skinned. Does it mean they're of African ancestry? No.   \"",

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

I must of hit a nerve with some \"\"idiots\"\" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!\"",

If you had paid attention while playing SH: Homecoming, you would have learned that Wheeler said that The Order is one to bear a grudge. They don't take kindly to people that don't share their beliefs. And they are known to have the ability to track people down. And in the translated book of memories, Silent Hill Hiroyuki Owaku stated that Cybil's fate is \"\"left to players' imaginations\"\".\n\nAlso, SH4 revealed that SH2 protagonist James Sunderland disappeared when he went to Silent Hill. Does that mean he died too? NO, not at all.\n\nPLEASE pay attention when you play video games. \n\nThank you. ;)\"",
