The D- that another editor had mentioned seems redundant and cant really be proven with a proper source unless there is a back history of ratings that comes from the BBB itself. I also thought that the BBB A+ was a nice touch to the lead paragraph as it counterbalanced the criticism however upon further review I realize that the criticism of MonaVie doesnt belong in the lead either and should be put in a seperate criticism section after a thorough evaluation of the claims made in those statements.",

Mathematicians are very fussy about them, and the MoS insists on them in that context.
