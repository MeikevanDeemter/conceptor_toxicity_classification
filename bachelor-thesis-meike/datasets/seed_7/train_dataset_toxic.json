Please stop reverting the edits on Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, you know it was released in 1988 and you are in the wrong about the year 1989, I am sorry, but seriously leave it as the correct year (1988). If you continue reverting it again, I have no choice but to report you. Please answer my last message at the talk page to see how it feels when you stop.   | talk 00:58, Jun 27, 2005 (UTC)",

He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",
