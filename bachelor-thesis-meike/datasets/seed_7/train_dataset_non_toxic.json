When I say peer review, I mean by those in academia - not our own peer review process. Your claims that they are an author's POV are spurious at best. The books he used are highly researched publications by noted members of their fields who spent years researching this subject.\n\nYou will need some serious sources to counter those presented by Chris. Also, before you go challenging his research, I wish to remind you of Chris' bona fides: he is a published author who is finishing his PhD in Gastronomy from Boston University, a major American University. You really need to step up if you wish to contradict his work.  (blah blah)",

The usage of \"\"disputed territory\"\" is POV, it reflects the extreme minority view that these territories are not occupied and disregards the overwhelming majority of sources that say that it is. This is the chosen language of the right wing of the Israeli political spectrum, and it is not in compliance with NPOV to use it in the encyclopedia's narrative voice. Additionally, the repeated usage of the terms Judea and Samaria when referring to a territory violates WP:WESTBANK. This edit should be reverted. nableezy - \"",

All of the content you see on Wikipedia is contributed by users like yourself, making it a sort of very large scale collaboration project. So if your use of the word \"\"moderation\"\" refers to the removal of vandalism, the answer is fairly simple: it too is all done by users, who keep a close eye on the recent changes around Wikipedia. There are some more complicated methods and tools that are employed to monitor these changes, but that's the simple answer. Is that what you were looking for?

I think that Canada's military contributions to the British Empire in the latter part of the 1800s and very early 1900s are a good indication of increased autonomy. There may not have been any formal granting of such autonomy, but it was exercised. Desmond Morton in A Military History of Canada (McClelland & Stewart 1999, ISBN 0-7710-6514-0) describes how Canada refused a British request for troops to be sent to fight in Africa in the mid-1880s and the initial denial of troops to fight in the Second Boer War (internal pressures eventually resulted in Canadians fighting in this war). The reluctance of French Canada to support Imperial conflicts likely hastened Canada's movement towards greater autonomy.",

Evidence for this is that where Silverman describes the normal outcome of tapping with distinction marked by length contrast on the preceding vowel, we read: \"\"*\u02c8VtV > \u02c8V\u0306\u027eV\"\" (Silverman 2004, p. 87). Also, this is consistent with how the length contrast on the preceding vowel is marked in other surroundings (e.g. in the cited table in \"\"knot\"\").\n\nWith regard to \"\"nod\"\", I think there is nothing wrong. It is pretty much the point of Silverman's article that in this particular position, de-voicing is common. Of course, additional sources would be nice.   \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude4a \"",

I see that you contributed a great deal to article previously. At one point, with about a half dozen edits, you added 24 ships to the section \"\"Ready Reserve Force ships\"\". You listed them all as belonging to the Cape Ducato class, however that is a class of only 5 ships. I'm wondering if you had other info that stated these other 19 ships were considered a part of that class? If not, then if you have some free time, would mind stopping by the article and help correct this? From what I've (briefly) read, most of these ships are from various sources, builders and countires. Some are listed as \"\"Type C7 ships\"\", while others don't have any such designation. Anyway, any help help you could provide would be appreciated. -  '''' \"",

It does not just mention one publication critical of his book, as does your article at present, but two critical ones and several in his defence, apparently all by experts. / \n\nI am far from making any claims myself, as I do not know much of mathematics, just I point out that matters seem to be not as simple as your piece suggests to readers.\n\nRegards,  147.142.186.54",

I'll update the reference as soon as I get a hold of the book again (since it was borrowed from the library, I will have to go there and get it but that won't be much of a problem). I'll also work on the Birbhum map per suggestions. As you might have noticed, I haven't had any time the last 10 days for wikipedia due to other pressures and I am hoping to clear the back log this weekend. I'll put a formal response on the FAC page in the meantime. Take care.",

In regards to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Deathlands, the tool closed it as Merge, presumably because it pulled out the word merge from the closing statement. However, the close is really more of an N/A, or a no consensus if you require specific terminology, since the result was that there couldn't be any real outcome for such a huge joint nomination of articles. serenC \"",

At larger resolutions, the image layout that I fixed would cause edit links to bunch up and/or be hidden and the pictures to do exactly what you are complaining about with stacking. Forcing sections to clear prevents that from happening. Yes, it introduces more whitespace at some resolutions, but it makes seeing the edit links much simpler at all resolutions (which is a good thing, outweighing minor whitespace problems). Given that at certain resolutions your layout actually hides all the editsection links, your layout is unintentionally bad, making it harder for people to edit. I have, accordingly, reverted.

Thanks! Iamunknown \n\n I learnt IPA during phonetics courses at university.  If you want to learn IPA then a course is probably the best plan, but otherwise there are books as well as  articles and exercises on the internet (including wikipedia).  It is worth training yourself to really listen and feel words a bit, as it is so easy to get misled by the spelling in English.  I hope this helps.",

Therefore, I'm sure you'll agree with the removal of that bullsh*t image at the top of the article, which represents Ireland as Germanic. Maybe you can create a more accurate/appropriate one.

The redirect already has the advantages of the notation of a turn in terms of tau (like a half revolution would be tau/2), but I believe a small discussion on the advantages on the sine function (like in this old Vi Hart video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7vhMMXagQ) would very much strengthen the argument. It doesn't have to be large. Or maybe that could appear on the sine page.",

No one even in Syriac says SURYAYE, they say Soraye, Suraye, etc. user:King Legit",

The only condition is if \"\"kriya yoga\"\" pages which directly relate to Mahavatar Babaji and the kriya technique revived by Mahavatar Babaji, are further disambiguated from other usages of kriya. I have now implemented this disambiguation.  Under these specific circumstances, I feel that the Lahiri Mahasaya-related usage of Mahavatar Babaji's Kriya Yoga should remain as the main article.   \"",
