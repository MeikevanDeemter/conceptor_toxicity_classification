Please stop reverting the edits on Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, you know it was released in 1988 and you are in the wrong about the year 1989, I am sorry, but seriously leave it as the correct year (1988). If you continue reverting it again, I have no choice but to report you. Please answer my last message at the talk page to see how it feels when you stop.   | talk 00:58, Jun 27, 2005 (UTC)",

He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

We say practice and enlightenment, or realization, are one. How is it one thing? When you sit, your zazen is the zazen of the Buddhas. Your zazen is sitting Buddha, or Buddha's zazen. So your practice is realization itself, enlightenment itself. Your zazen becomes anuttara samyak sambodhi itself. Have this kind of faith. \nUsually when you do zazen, zazen becomes a cause to create some kind of effect, such as enlightenment, frustration, anger, or whatever arises. That is the wrong way to do zazen. Your practice is not something by which you attain some place else or something else. Your practice itself is a fulfillment of honsho myoshu, the originally enlightened life.",

Your added text is quite verbose and uses a lot of direct speech without adding much additional information. Note that this section is dealing with Sellers' personality and his struggles in very general way, and magnifying a small event like this gives it undue weight.

You can see for yourself that there has never been a consensus at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Hebrew) and Wikipedia:WikiProject Hebrew languages and that therefore Wikipedia respects Hebrew as it is used and spoken by both Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardi Jews, by modern Israelis as Modern Hebrew and as in Biblical Hebrew.

Since you can't get on even after a factory reset, you could try modifyin your router DHCP settings so that the subnet it's assigning everything to includes the static IP you assigned for the extender (and if that still doesn't work, the factory default).  Assuming the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, then this just means the first 3 sections of the IP need to be the same.",

According to the deletion log, a page of this name has been deleted twice this yearm so I'll try to explain both cases:\n The first deletion was due to WP:CSD#A7 Speedy Deletion Criterion #7 - non-notable. All Wikipedia content must be WP:NN notable and WP:V verifiable. This could have been avoided by indicating the grounds for perceived notability of the article subject. \n The second deletion was due to WP:CSD#G10 Speedy Deletion Criterion 10 - the administrators identified the page to be an Wikipedia:Attack_page attack page. The page has been deleted due to no personal attacks policy. This could have probably been avoided if you followed the guidelines in Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.",

It could mean black, but most of the times it means dark and especially in this case. As for the word preto: preto means black. It is basically the word for black (the colour). I'll change the article myself, if you don't mind. Glad I could help! ;) 22:20, 18 January 2006\"",

That month TVNewser's new editorial team was brought on board: editor Chris Ariens, a 15-year TV news producer and manager and contributors Gail Shister, one of the foremost Television reporters in the country and Alissa Krinsky a Chicago-based former news reporter and anchor. A few months later, former Fox News Channel production assistant and NBC page Steve Krakauer joined us as our associate editor. Steve moved on in June, 2009 and in July we welcomed Kevin Allocca as our new editor.  This more than makes the case that they are professional journalists.",

All of the content you see on Wikipedia is contributed by users like yourself, making it a sort of very large scale collaboration project. So if your use of the word \"\"moderation\"\" refers to the removal of vandalism, the answer is fairly simple: it too is all done by users, who keep a close eye on the recent changes around Wikipedia. There are some more complicated methods and tools that are employed to monitor these changes, but that's the simple answer. Is that what you were looking for?

We are not writing a biography, rather we are writing a small biographical article.  Ms. Horton may well have played jacks as a child.  I may even find a source for this information.  Nevertheless, the information is irrelevant and unnecessary for our readers to get a snapshot of who Ms. Horton is today.  The fact that she worked two jobs to pay for flying lessons demonstrates her dedication to her intended profession.  The fact that she worked at a car dealership and a pharmacy, as opposed to a gas station and a supermarket, tells me absolutely nothing.  It does not add to the article, but it does make the article worse.   (talk)",

I think that Canada's military contributions to the British Empire in the latter part of the 1800s and very early 1900s are a good indication of increased autonomy. There may not have been any formal granting of such autonomy, but it was exercised. Desmond Morton in A Military History of Canada (McClelland & Stewart 1999, ISBN 0-7710-6514-0) describes how Canada refused a British request for troops to be sent to fight in Africa in the mid-1880s and the initial denial of troops to fight in the Second Boer War (internal pressures eventually resulted in Canadians fighting in this war). The reluctance of French Canada to support Imperial conflicts likely hastened Canada's movement towards greater autonomy.",

The good news is that they can be seen and that they are apparently considered to be national treasures, being in the main display in the high security \"\"gold room\"\". The bad news is that as I was taking pictures of them, a guard told me that it is forbidden to take pictures in that section of the museum, and when I got home the pictures were of too bad quality anyway.  \"",

The reason why it may not be so in India is because the Pashtuns and Indians have not come into contact on a large scale and perhaps even more after 1947. Also the reason you might see it on internet and blogs is because of lack of education. Perhaps 30 years ago you would hear the N-word being used like this also but later it grew out of vogue and politically incorrect. Similarly I provided an Academic Reference clearly stating that we Pashtuns find it derogatory. Hope  can respect this sentiment. Best wishes and regards",

Also, I now understand your point about involved parties in a court case becoming primary sources on topics related to the case, per the NOTW example. I'm still not convinced that Bar & Bench is not a reliable source - I'll try looking into that a bit more, but I see your rationale for not using it, particularly in case of a BLP.A somewhat speculative question: suppose that if and when the court case is settled, and *if* there is sufficient media coverage of that, would the lawsuit itself be notable enough for an article (that would not be subject to BLP restrictions)?Anyways, thanks again for helping me out,  talk \"",

There are various student-run newspapers on campus that make explicit mention about various topics concerning the festival, and our school even has senior projects (required for receipt of a Bachelor's degree) that are about the logistics and coordination of the festival.

The term \"\"integrated resort\"\" is certainly not a euphemism for casino: it means something entirely different.   \"",
