However, I would like help understanding your rationale. Why is it kosher to count neutral votes as opposes? Perhaps I misunderstand the point of a neutral vote, but it seems to me you have chosen to count a nominally neutral voter's comments as a de facto oppose vote. Wouldn't those who voted neutral (i.e., no opinion one way or the other) have voted to oppose if that's what they'd intended? This strikes me as being tantamount to co\u00f6pting votes, and given that the difference between discarding the neutrals and counting them as opposes is the difference between 68% and 75% support, I would like to better understand this aspect of the consensus doctrine.

The admins (the real unbiased admins unlike yourself) told me I ned to reg to be taken seriously with a complaint. The fact that you are much like a Nazi (you seem to think it's your right to spread false truths about the lib party, and your anti-gay adoption and marriage views speak volumes about the type of person you are). Not to mention you wasted time and effort to get \"\"some developer\"\" (who I'm sure shares your bigoted views) to find something \"\"out.\"\"\n\nSeeing as how you're more interested in propaganda than the truth, this post probably won't have a long shelf life. We know you like to spin the truth to ensure yourself and your party are seen in a positive light.\n\nI hope Mark knows where you stand on these issues. - PSYCH 06:48, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)\"",

The problem at James Burke (science historian), is that the link you've added leads to White, which is about the colour white, not about the ethnicity.  If you had linked to white people, that would make more sense. Always remember to check your work ;) \n\nHowever, the \"\"ethnicity\"\" field in the infobox seems quite bizarre to me. As you said about \"\"caucasian\"\", it's an \"\"outdated racial categorisation\"\", and I havne't seen it used before in other articles. I'm going to remove it entirely from that article, until I get some feedback from the folks who know about these things at Template_talk:Infobox_Person#Ethnicity. \n\nHope that helps. Thanks.    \"",
