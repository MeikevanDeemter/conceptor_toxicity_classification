You only took that user to wp:ani because they refused your help. Then you allowed their messages to be deleted which quite clearly show they are willing to undergo teaching, but because it wasn't from you, you didn't like that did you? Without a doubt the removal of barnstars and reaction to the welcome message was beyond the pale, and should have been dealt with by a short admin block, but your dishonesty surrounding this matter is utterly repulsive. I am very, very tempted to create an account just to have you dealt with for your actions. 92.20.50.154",

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

In fact, the relevant userbox sat in his userspace along with such uncontroversial personal information as his being male and what state he lives in. It's common on this site that editors declare facets of their individuality to build a sense of community that creates another incentive for us to be here and work on articles, just as workers everywhere chat around the water cooler and companies tolerate some slacking off as long as the work gets done. We have different standards on a volunteer site, but indicating someone declaring his sexual orientation will make others \"\"feel turned on\"\" is creation of unnecessary drama. - t \"",

He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

So I'd expect an Australian to understand one of my articles on a pre-metrification Australian ship just fine. Your argument, and that of the MOS itself, has a great deal more merit when no conversions are given so that people can't grasp the scale of things properly. Since my articles can be fully understood by people on both sides of the Imperial/metric scales, I view it more as a matter of taste. And, quite honestly, since I have a large number of FA, A-, and GA-class articles under my belt, most reviewers seem to agree as no one's ever challenged me on this particular point before.",
