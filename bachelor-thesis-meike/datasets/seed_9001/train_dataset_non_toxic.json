For the Handball at the 2011 Pan American Games, an article which I greatly contributed to I believed it was better to standardize across all the sport sub-pages. So that is what I did and proposed the image to be deleted (because it was not going to be in use). The only other image I proposed to be deleted was the wrong logo of a proposed bid. It was never my intention to edit war, but again GB fan felt otherwise to revert everything I did even when I left valid explanations.

We have not had one as Abp. since Cardinal Carberry retired in the early 1980's (he died in about 1998).  I think as the church becomes less a European and North American church we will see fewer cardinals from small and mid-sized diocese like STL and more from Africa, Asia, and South America.

The FBI keeps very detailed national records on crime, but the way it presents rape data obscures the racial element rather than clarifies it. Dr. William Wilbanks, a criminologist at Florida International University, had to sift carefully through the data to find that in 1988 there were 9,406 cases of black-on-white rape and fewer than ten cases of white-on-black rape.

The testicle cuffs extended between the legs, and each man was connected to the next by a rope between their genitals. These tight metal bindings on their scrotums were to ensure that a quick pace was kept, for if a man were to stop walking the rope would pull and cause quick, sharp pain in the genital region. doesn't sound vaguely historical, source it or I'll remove it.",

We don't even know the order of kings or have any idea of the length of their reigns for centuries of Egyptian history.  Even for dynasties we know well, like the 18th, there's no fully agreed upon chronology.  Relationships among monarchs are frequently not known.  Over all, it would probably take far less time to say what we do know about the pharaohs than what we don't, because we barely know anything at all about even a well known pharaoh like Ramesses II, as compared to, say, a modern figure of comparable importance and longevity like Louis XIV. The list given was completely arbitrary, and gave no idea why these problems, out of all the huge number of things we don't know, were being listed on the main Pharaoh page.  I think it's best for it to not be here.",

You are right about Science and Creationism going in two different directions - Science starts with the facts and looks for an answer, which in this case is most likely Evolution. Creationism starts with the answer (your reading of the Bible - I say that advisably because most Christian leaders don't agree with your interpretation) and then makes up the facts to suit.

    "text": "\"\n\n BUSH AND JFK \n\nThe recent 50th anniversary upsurge in Kennedy assasination interest and the imminent releast of classified information in 2017 has caused many conspiracy theories to be re-examined.  More often GHW Bush's name is linked as a conspirator and funder of the conspiracy.  His favoring of Nixon at the time and his oil interests superficially endorse this theory, as does the depth of Nixon's corrupt and dupklicitous influence on those close to him.\n\nI feel the biog needs to highlight this aspect of GHWB's career, especially as both Bush presidents were such avid war-mongers their financial interests must have relied heavily on the \"\"military-industrial\"\" influence that Eisenhower warned the nation against.  Bush's attitudes to war in the middle east directly reflects the false policies which prolonged the Vietnam war.\"",

What originally is an economic contradiction is taken as something else, just because it is convenient as anti-communist propaganda. And you know very well how propaganda works. It is a misinterpretation in many cases of what is originally a communism-capitalism problem to be stated as a communism-religious group contradiction. If a religious group (an Jews, Catholics, Muslims,... serve the same as examples) stand in anticommunists stances then, of course, they will get reaction from the communists. The rest is just propaganda, ignorance and opportunistic intentions.    \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.231.81.164   \"",

Maybe the influences could be expanded further, maybe cite influences such as 'the clash', does the article even mention that Mick Jones produced their album?\n\nI read this article and I have virtually no idea what kind of music this band plays. It's great that the front man makes a fool of himself constantly, but this is an article about a band, not an anti-heroin commercial. Could someone please write a few sentences about the music?  \nWow. I reread the article and realised you were entirely right. There wasn't even the usual description of style in the first sentence.

Third, saying that the 1972 West Valley shutdown had anything to do with President Carter's 1977 decision seems like patent nonsense - if it's not, there should be better sources.  Fourth, the obvious intent of GNEP is to do the reprocessing overseas - there's never been a ban on that that I'm aware of, only on reprocessing of civilian spent nuclear fuel inside the U.S.  There may be valid points here: get a better source to back up the allegations made  in this one.",

As a long-time editor of Wikipedia, I would like to stress that the key to not going crazy here is patience and thick skin. Instead of trying to reinvent Wikipedia, I would encourage you to try changing Wikipedia one small step at a time. It isn't easy, but the results can be very significant. I've had 101 policy and project ideas shot down, but I've also had a small handful that have been successful, and hopefully those small successes have made Wikipedia a better place. By the way, if you really are sick of Wikipedia, you may want to take a look at Veropedia. It's not perfect, but it has some good points (and most of the editors and admins are Wikipedia alum). Anyway, good luck with whatever you decide to do!",
