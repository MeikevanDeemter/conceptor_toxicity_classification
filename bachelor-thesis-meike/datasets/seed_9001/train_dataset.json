You only took that user to wp:ani because they refused your help. Then you allowed their messages to be deleted which quite clearly show they are willing to undergo teaching, but because it wasn't from you, you didn't like that did you? Without a doubt the removal of barnstars and reaction to the welcome message was beyond the pale, and should have been dealt with by a short admin block, but your dishonesty surrounding this matter is utterly repulsive. I am very, very tempted to create an account just to have you dealt with for your actions. 92.20.50.154",

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

In fact, the relevant userbox sat in his userspace along with such uncontroversial personal information as his being male and what state he lives in. It's common on this site that editors declare facets of their individuality to build a sense of community that creates another incentive for us to be here and work on articles, just as workers everywhere chat around the water cooler and companies tolerate some slacking off as long as the work gets done. We have different standards on a volunteer site, but indicating someone declaring his sexual orientation will make others \"\"feel turned on\"\" is creation of unnecessary drama. - t \"",

He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

So I'd expect an Australian to understand one of my articles on a pre-metrification Australian ship just fine. Your argument, and that of the MOS itself, has a great deal more merit when no conversions are given so that people can't grasp the scale of things properly. Since my articles can be fully understood by people on both sides of the Imperial/metric scales, I view it more as a matter of taste. And, quite honestly, since I have a large number of FA, A-, and GA-class articles under my belt, most reviewers seem to agree as no one's ever challenged me on this particular point before.",

Data derived from Department of Justice, Criminal Victimization in the United States, 1987, p. 53. \n\nPROPOSED ADDITION:\n\nBecause interracial rape is now overwhelmingly black on white, it has become difficult to do research on it or to find relevant statistics. The FBI keeps very detailed national records on crime, but the way it presents rape data obscures the racial element rather than clarifies it. Dr. William Wilbanks, a criminologist at Florida International University, had to sift carefully through the data to find that in 1988 there were 9,406 cases of black-on-white rape and fewer than ten cases of white-on-black rape.

You are right about Science and Creationism going in two different directions - Science starts with the facts and looks for an answer, which in this case is most likely Evolution. Creationism starts with the answer (your reading of the Bible - I say that advisably because most Christian leaders don't agree with your interpretation) and then makes up the facts to suit.

Is his opinion notable? That's a close call. I'm calling for quite a bit of discussion about what observers say about the trial.  He's saying he doesn't like the US response, not that he agrees with the verdict.  The lengthy criticism section I put together wasn't necessarily intended to go in as is.

I don't see what the big deal is, but evidently people are really uptight about seduction community-related stuff. They give a lot more tolerance to the various other subcultures on Wikipedia, e.g. the various sci-fi communities creating articles for all the nuances of their fictional universes. I think they have just been more successful at organizing resistance to AfDs. After all, they have [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Star Trek/Participants|a freakin' lot of participants].

Instead of trying to reinvent Wikipedia, I would encourage you to try changing Wikipedia one small step at a time. It isn't easy, but the results can be very significant. I've had 101 policy and project ideas shot down, but I've also had a small handful that have been successful, and hopefully those small successes have made Wikipedia a better place. By the way, if you really are sick of Wikipedia, you may want to take a look at Veropedia. It's not perfect, but it has some good points (and most of the editors and admins are Wikipedia alum).

He assured me (and provided some credible refs from the Sharia) that Islam acknowledges Jesus' status as a prophet and respects him accordingly, but it is against fundamental teachings (and even court rulings) to celebrate the birthday of a prophet. I had originally wanted to include the material on the basis of NPOV, but he convinced me that it's either a fabrication, or taken out of context and distorted. The discussion and refs are in the archives (probably late Oct. - early Nov. somewhere). Since then I've been removing the material (it pops up fairly often) because the part that is verifiable isn't relevant to the article, and the part that's relevant is not only unverified, but strongly disputed. I suggest we continue removing it until solid and very specific refs are provided to support it.  Tropics \"",
