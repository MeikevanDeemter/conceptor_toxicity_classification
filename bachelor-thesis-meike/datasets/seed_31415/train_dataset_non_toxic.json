From memory, the debate ended with Dublin getting it's 1.2 million restored on the basis that a local authority administrative area doesn't necessarily define the population of a town/city when the commonly accepted boundaries are very different. Charlesland is certainly in Greystones in my view; indeed a case could be made that Delgany  and Kilcoole are now merely parts of Greystones - but of course by the same reasoning Bray is part of Dublin's population.

He was very easily liked...by everyone. We enjoyed many nights out on liberty and he was a fine gentleman. We became good friends. I was sitting in my living room in Adak, Alaska (1985) when I saw his picture on the news. I was both shocked, and shaken to hear of his death. It will remain with me to my death.

I completed an entire copy-edit of the article, but I'm going to have to fail this, mainly because it doesn't cover enough material. The \"\"Bostaph's departure\"\" section does not belong in this article, as, while it does mention the DVD, his leave from the band has nothing to do with it. With that gone, I would recommend you look at other example concert video GAs, such as Number Ones (video) and Celebration: The Video Collection, as well as WP:ALBUM#Article body for some ideas. Also, use a bit less quotations, as it disrupts the flow when reading. This is really close to passing in my book, however, so don't give this up! EricLeb01 ( | Talk) \"",

The reason I reverted your edit is because there are dozens of articles using the template which do not have a specific value for the CoA width parameter, based on the assumption that the default width was 120px. When you removed this default width value, many templates suddenly found themselves with HUGE coats of arms, which were visually striking and quite ugly. Therefore, I believe the default width of 120px should be kept. If you wish to remove it entirely, then you should first ensure that all the articles using the template have a specific value for the width parameter. Regards.",

A find the plural form more logical, since iptycene is a general name, several compounds with varying constitution qualify as an iptycene. I understand that e. g. arene and alkene articles are also in singular, but I don't really understand why. Is it simply a matter of agreement? Thank you.",

My guess would be the listing of the vandals IP address in the comment. If this is the reason I don't especially mind, although I would be interested in knowing which Wikipedia user utilizes that IP if you have the ability to use checkuser on them. I believe it is pertinent to the ongoing debate over the inclusion of the ED article, especially concerning issues of NPOV which have come up. 24.23.212.107",

If I'm reading it correctly it's saying... Luis Filipe was the shortest serving head of state. Actually we kid, he was never the head of state so he can't have been the shortest serving.

Another dog\u2019s breakfast maybe (-:? The good reason to doubt the de Soto free-fall claim was Grant\u2019s claim that he predicted uniform acceleration in a homogeneous medium. The good reason to suspect the Jovian moons case was simply that it is nonsense. They only support epicyclical astronomy in general, whether geocentric or heliocentric. Elementary my dear Wilson !

But please note that these paitings do NOT even have symbolic representations because of half a dozen differences and illusions I mentioned in my talks. The difference include the kind of dress, seat, turban, chinese looking face and many many more (look above in my talks or otherwise dont throw those questions which have been answered already, please).",

Darwin, Weismann and Wiedersheim (who is credited with coining the term 'vestigial' to refer to them) all used it in this way right from the beginning, in the 19th century.

You should edit your own countries posts and articles. What sources do you have about Macedonia?? This is Macedonian football history and has nothing to do with you.If you are destroying in purpose all the Macedonian articles by twisting the truth and reality it doesn't help at all. You are just doing Chauvinist propaganda and you spread National hate. Remember if you spread bad propaganda against your neighbor countries ,that means your country is bad too ,think about it. You should give a support and improve the image of the region ,instead destroying it.And remember you have no Macedonian sources for any Macedonian article simply because you aren't Macedonian ,only Macedonians can edit delete or post for their own subject and matter.",

Could you let me know? I recently added a newer photo at the bottom, with permission from the copyright holder as a \"\"promo.\"\" I linked back to the copyright holder's website. I'd like to help you make the copyright status of the photo you used correct if there's anything needed to be done. I did that for the Alex Chilton photo for instance: I tracked down the website owner for the photo (a record label) and got their permission. Is there anything I can do to help you with the photo you used?\n 22:12, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)\"",

In fact when I am preparing updates I frequently review and promote hooks on the fly because I can't find a suitable mix in the available reviewed hooks. Hope that helps.",

Thanks.168.215.139.83    \u2014 Preceding undated comment added  \nHi, vandalism from school IPs is very common, and we do procedurally issue lengthy blocks based on contribution history. Here however no vandalism has occurred since the release of the block, so I simply don't feel comfortable blocking yet. For schools account creation is normally disabled, but this is only the case for the first 24 hours after the block is issued. Best \u2014  talk \n\"",
