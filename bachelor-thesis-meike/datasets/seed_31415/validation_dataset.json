No other mainstream media has reported on it. And again the everlasting propaganda war of this civil war.

Late in the year, they lost at home against London (ref decided to steal the show late in the match, so to speak), and both games against Chicago, all of which were crucial to playoff positioning. A few of us went to the game in London to witness their last chance at a playoff bid (they needed a win, a draw was as good as a loss). They had their chances, but just couldn't finish, as the game ended 0-0. Quite a disappointing end to the season. Very frustrating. Good luck to you and HUFC in the playoffs!",
