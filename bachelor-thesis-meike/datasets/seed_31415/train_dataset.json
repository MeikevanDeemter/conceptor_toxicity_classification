I must of hit a nerve with some \"\"idiots\"\" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!\"",

Why do you think more and more people are trying Gay sex!? Its okay, (IMO) to have a wife and kids and enjoy some Gay sex now and then! (no Meth or poppers though!)  \"\"Try it, you'll like it!\"\" \u0394butler\u2022 \"",

Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died?

He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Ch\u00e1vez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

I am extremely grateful that you took the time to advise me on to improve as a Wikipedian and I'd like to assure you that I'll do my level best to develop my skills here to a point where you may feel you could trust me with the mop.\n\nI've been blown away by the level of interest taken in my RFA and appreciate the time and energy dedicated by all the editors who have contributed to it, support, oppose and neutral alike.  I hope to bump into you again soon and look forward to serving you and Wikipedia in any way I can.  Cheers!    (the non-admin, formerly known as Budgiekiller)",

From memory, the debate ended with Dublin getting it's 1.2 million restored on the basis that a local authority administrative area doesn't necessarily define the population of a town/city when the commonly accepted boundaries are very different.

My edits are the most thoroughly referenced and thus if any further edits are down unto this article- it should be to remove anything aside from what I have included. \nThe Chinese Zheng Ho Wali songo fairytale has been disproven once and for all as a total lie disproven by archeological reality.

Fact is that the Britons were in an anti-Angles coalition and the Angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. If the Britons had contact to the former Roman Empire is unclear but possible. They lived under Roman rule for centuries and were romanized. This defeat was something like de-romanizing to them after 500 years of Roman rule. This can clearly be seen when you read and understand the Roman Britain-Anglo-Saxon battles in Germanic Wars.",

Therefore we should not be accepting the controversial move to R\u00edo de la Plata as a fait accompli and should really be discussing a move from what was the status quo - i.e. River Plate to R\u00edo de la Plata. As a consequence the 60% majority normally required for a move to River Plate should be ignored and only 40% of the vote should be required to restore this page to what was the status quo. I cannot believe anyone with any sense of fair play could legitimately defend the position of making a controversial move and then having a vote on whether to keep the new name where the balance lies in its favour, it is just not the Wiki way.",

Feel free to ignore this, of course, or to keep the answers to yourself - although I'm also genuinely curious about your answers. \n\nOn the same token, even if you don't escalate, I'm always happy to discuss any of my edits, or the articles more generally, with you or anyone else. I am always open to being convinced by sufficient evidence.   \"",

The \"\"Bostaph's departure\"\" section does not belong in this article, as, while it does mention the DVD, his leave from the band has nothing to do with it. With that gone, I would recommend you look at other example concert video GAs, such as Number Ones (video) and Celebration: The Video Collection, as well as WP:ALBUM#Article body for some ideas. Also, use a bit less quotations, as it disrupts the flow when reading. This is really close to passing in my book, however, so don't give this up! EricLeb01 ( | Talk) \"",

Most of us know the main criticisms made at CAD in any event (templated, unfunny, rip-off of other webcomics, bad pacing, insipid storylines, etc etc). But just because other people have that opinion of CAD doesn't necessarily make it necessary to include a criticism section. I mean, I think Limp Bizkit suck. I also think CAD sucks, if I'm being honest. But rather than force my opinion on others, I just don't listen to Limp Bizkit, and I don't read CAD. Problem solved. 58.108.241.214",

A more specific way to identify English people might be to assert that they must have some belief in a shared common ancestry with other people living in what is now England, though this is a subjective belief because all human groups have a demonstrable close and recent shared ancestry.   \"",

When you removed this default width value, many templates suddenly found themselves with HUGE coats of arms, which were visually striking and quite ugly. Therefore, I believe the default width of 120px should be kept. If you wish to remove it entirely, then you should first ensure that all the articles using the template have a specific value for the width parameter. Regards.",

The article in question has been fully protected for 4 days to help a consensus come out of this. Happy editing.  [[User_Talk:DeltaQuad| (t) ]]  (e) \"",

I believe the support should be aware about the clubs history and current situation. Also, as the only football team from the relatively big East Craigs area, I believe that is also a reason to have it on Wikipedia.

On December 30 of that same year, Ugo Ungaza Villegas, a young Bolivian, damaged the painting by throwing a rock at it.\n\nCan anyone perhaps elaborate on this? I mean, the dousing of the painting with acid is reported as though this is a normal thing to be done to a masterpiece and so nothing further needs to be said about it. Did someone just stroll into the Louvre with a beaker of acid and throw it onto the painting? I'd be interested to know the circumstances of this event, in particular why this was done and how it was allowed to happen. Who did it? What was the motivation? How was it repaired? etc. etc. |Talk \"",

If I'm reading it correctly it's saying... Luis Filipe was the shortest serving head of state. Actually we kid, he was never the head of state so he can't have been the shortest serving.

Darwin, Weismann and Wiedersheim (who is credited with coining the term 'vestigial' to refer to them) all used it in this way right from the beginning, in the 19th century.

The gender loss is more pronounced in Danish which has had a profound influence from Low German which though does have three genders, but the masc and femininum only distinguishable in the acussative case. 83.233.143.252  20:16, 30 July",

In fact when I am preparing updates I frequently review and promote hooks on the fly because I can't find a suitable mix in the available reviewed hooks. Hope that helps.",

Lastly, why is Muhammad of Ghori included in the gallery of Tajiks? He was not Taik, the ghorids themselves were believed to be Pashtuns and they were NOT native speakers of the Persian language rather patronizers of the culture. There seems to be a lot of vandalism and propaganda being posted by Tajiks here themselves, with no evidence being provided. I also request the Tajik article to be removed to the \"\"Persian People\"\" article as a sub-category to erase confusion of Tajiks being a separate group.\n\n  Akmal94\"",
