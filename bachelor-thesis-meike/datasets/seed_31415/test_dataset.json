Apart from that, I noticed that the statement is written in present tense, but the lens seems to be out of production as of 2014. Instead of searching for a reference for that, I suggest to simply remove the FA* and put in the rather new DA 560mm instead. It is marked AW so it should have the same improved sealing as the DA* lenses have.   \"",
