After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Ch\u00e1vez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

Removing mentions of firms such as Southside United (one of the original firms in Denmark) that actually is mentioned in the source, albeit misspelled \"\"South Side United\"\" by some scummy journalist cunt who's research probably was two coppers and a google search, while keeping Blue Front which could be seen as their youth group, as well as Squad 92 which ALSO is mentioned in the source article, does not make any sense whatsoever. Removing CC Youth Division could make a bit more sense, but the group is also mentioned in the article, though as Young Boys which simply is an old name. So please, stop your amateurish source-checks, where you remove firms that actually are mentioned in the given sources and are generally a fucking cunt. Thank you in advance.\n\n== \"",

In my opinion, the article should stick to historical facts that are _manifestly true_, such as the fact he served in the Bush administration, under which bureau, some of his acts and accomplishments there etc. All this subterfuge smacks of character assassination by editors out to paint this man in a negative fashion. You can dig up negative articles on nearly any public figure, that doesn't make them encyclopedic nor scholarly.\"",

They're not for making personal attacks, they're not for tarnishing someone's reputation. Whatever information is inserted into the biography of a living person (see WP:BLP) needs to be neutrally written and supported by reliable sources. But I think this is nothing new. I have started two sock puppet investigations so a CheckUser can figure out if any socking is going on. No further accusations, therefore, will be necessary: it's out of all of our hands right now.

The article Tritone explains that in detail, and the topic has already been discussed. Are you going to delete the article as well? By the way, if you accept the definition of Whole tone given by Grove online (see above), then you also need to accept the obvious consequence that a d5 can be decomposed into three tones (one of which is a d3), and hence can be called Tritone.",

Wikipedia is not designed to endorse anything, it is simply designed to inform about it. Why people are vandalizing the IE page is beyond me, but it's becoming a major problem. The page was recently unlocked for 3 hours, and it got raped. I think some better anti-vandalism features need to be added. It seems as if someone has a personal vendetta against IE and is encouraging other people to join them. And look at the history of the IE article - it's a page stretching flooded nightmare.",

I spent some years reading and applying NLP techniques, and, indeed, the techniques \"\"worked.\"\" I was very aware of what Bradbury points out, over and over, that Bandler and Grinder made a crucial distinction between actual practices and effectiveness and the conceptual models that were presented by \"\"master therapists,\"\" such as Perls, Satir, and Erikson, and this would obviously apply to NLP as an approach as well as anything else. My own experience is, of course, anecdotal. But the results were little short of astonishing. That does not establish NLP as a \"\"science,\"\" but as more of an \"\"art.\"\" The articles on NLP should reflect this understanding, based on reliable sources, and care should be taken about avoiding defining NLP so as to set up straw man arguments.   \n\n\"",

My information came from a Ranking Member of American Jujitsu and a Ranking Member of Australia Martial Arts (Chris Parker).  It is confirmed information.

None on my contacts who have contacts in Japan can find any of her Dojos in Japan.  \n\nI understand you are well versed in the subject matter or Martial Arts, so am I. I am also well versed in History of Warrior Societies.  She is claiming things that do not link up with History.\n\nIs there a better way that it should have been edited on my part? \n\nBerzerker",
