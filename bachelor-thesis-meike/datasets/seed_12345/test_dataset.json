Well he is my stupid friend. We were doing a project on how wikipedia has changed the world and he decided to vandalise. I need to log on to finish the project. Can you please unblock OsamaAlQueda(911wasawesome) or just give back the internet and the ability to log on to wikipedia? (I assure you OsamaAlQueda(911wasawesome) will never vandalise again, I'll make sure of it). I am sincerely sorry for any discomfort this has caused you..",

A particular consideration is that Ignatieff is standing for Liberal leadership candidate and has already attracted politicised edits, which are likely to increase as the December leadership election approaches. I have been playing safe, as there have been very constructive discussions on the talk page, and I've been afraid of these being sabotaged by ill-meaning contributions. One of the previous problems was disruption from dynamic IPs. That's the situation, and I would welcome your advice on this as someone from an objective viewpoint.",
