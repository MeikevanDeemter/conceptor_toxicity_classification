They also told me to plant it in full sun to light shade, and that it would grow to about 12-15 feet tall and 6-8 feet wide.  (That turns out to be a good choice for my landscape, because planting another spruce tree would have been too tall for the power lines that I planted it under.)\n\nEither my garden center is participating in a conspiracy to suppress the truth about Thuja occidentalis, or this article is giving too much weight to the medicinal nature of the plant.

Some of his images (including clear copyvios) have been moved to the commons, so I guess they'll have to be deleted there. Some he's given a website source (who are almost certainly not the copyright holders), in some he's said \"\"with permission\"\" then tagged it as free. Given his history of dishonesty, I wouldn't take his word for it that permission was gotten, and it's not clear if it's a wp only permission. On one there's a pretty detailed source, and it's free if it's true, but again I simply don't believe him.  \"",

However, you have also changed the indents quite a bit, e.g. sometimes replacing two colons with three bullets and sometimes replacing four colons with ten bullets; I assume these were a careless mistakes. Could you please revert your changes so the indents are as they were? In general, I think refactoring contentious discussion is more trouble than it's worth because it can be error prone. If you must refactor, please use a detailed edit summary; you didn't use an edit summary at all here. Thanks,",

There are two types of outlines: sentence outlines (like those you made in school to plan a paper), and topic outlines (like the topical synopses that professors hand out at the beginning of a college course). Outlines on Wikipedia are primarily topic outlines that serve 2 main purposes: they provide taxonomical classification of subjects showing what topics belong to a subject and how they are related to each other (via their placement in the tree structure), and as subject-based tables of contents linked to topics in the encyclopedia. The hierarchy is maintained through the use of heading levels and indented bullets. See Wikipedia:Outlines for a more in-depth explanation.  The Transhumanist \"",

Is this some obscure usage of \"\"they\"\" which can simultaneously refer to Romans and Jordanians as the same entity, while lumping together a 2000-year-old theocratic monarchy with a republic founded by atheist nationalists as \"\"us\"\"?  Anyway, if you want to expand on the American colony or the shopping area, I'm sure more information on other East Jerusalem neighborhoods would be a welcome addition. -  7 July 2005 18:49 (UTC)\"",

However, observationally, I do see an ethnic component. My town is a predominantly middle-class suburb of 46,000, with a much higher percentage of blacks, Latinos, and Armenians than the U.S. or state averages. These middle-class families tend to be more multigenerational than white middle-class families; thus, I think it is more acceptable for white middle-class families to be multigenerational here.  03:11, 11 October",
