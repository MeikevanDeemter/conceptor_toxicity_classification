It's generally considered better to move pages rather than to create a duplicate article then delete the old one, as the history is then preserved. Check out WP:MOVE for more details. To delete an article, meanwhile, you can add a [[WP:SPEEDY|speedy deletion template - {{db-}} followed by a specific request. For example, in the case of a biography, it would be {{db-bio}}, or {{db-redirect}} for a redirect. Hope this helps. Cheers",

As you point out, there were actually two instances of peremptory deletions by you since the ArbCom case finished just one month ago. Deleting properly sourced material and then daring other users to revert your edit, or requiring them to go through a long discussion to get it restored, are not great ways to relate to your fellow editors and their contributions. In the future, if you have a question about a source, please use one of the many specific templates before further peremptory deletions of cited material.

    "text": "\"Disgusting==\nThis guy is a disgusting sex columnist. He revels in it. He does it on purpose, and it's what gives him and his column their edge. It seperates him from every other sex advice giver I've ever read  and it's his signature attitude, tone, and approach to the issues. But there seems to be no way to adduce this highly pertinent and relevant information without violating the lame, loose, sloppy, ill-thought-out NPOV rule. Hilariously (and disgustingly), people tell me providing this information violates article \"\"neutrality.\"\" Any help here by any person of quality, integrity, and intelligence would be appreciated.    \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.44.129.156   \nImagine that  a sex columnist who enjoys sex.  How can we work that into the article?  ;-)    \n\n==\"",
