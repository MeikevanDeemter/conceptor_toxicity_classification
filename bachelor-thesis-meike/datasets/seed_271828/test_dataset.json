Many places says there will not be a spinoff, although I think there should because they screwed up the entire ending.  Will was supposed to have a baby with Grace but that stupid Leo guy ruined everything.  So if there is a spinoff will it take place after 2024? Because it was 2006 when Grace's daughter was born and 18 years later when she went to college it would be 2024. Did Lila get married to Ben after college or right away? The show didn't say. Another question is that if Will is Gay why did he have sex with a girl and date two other girls? Why did Will have a girl friend and why did he even date Grace if he was Gay?~~~~",
