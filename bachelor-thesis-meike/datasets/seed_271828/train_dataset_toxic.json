It seems that you've lost the joy in editing Wikipedia, and now you do as some sort of way of making yourself feel better at the expense of others. What a small, small man you are. Grow up! Get a life! Find yourself a girl to have sex with or something, because the way you've been sliding downhill is bringing everyone else at this fine institution down. I'm here to create an encyclopedia. You seem to be here to fight with other people and cause disruptions. You're making everyone else's life harder. Please stop that; just go away.\n\nRespectfully,\n \n\nBlanking is considered vandalism. Please refrain.",

They don't take kindly to people that don't share their beliefs. And they are known to have the ability to track people down. And in the translated book of memories, Silent Hill Hiroyuki Owaku stated that Cybil's fate is \"\"left to players' imaginations\"\".\n\nAlso, SH4 revealed that SH2 protagonist James Sunderland disappeared when he went to Silent Hill.

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",
