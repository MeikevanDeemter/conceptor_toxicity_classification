It seems that you've lost the joy in editing Wikipedia, and now you do as some sort of way of making yourself feel better at the expense of others. What a small, small man you are. Grow up! Get a life! Find yourself a girl to have sex with or something, because the way you've been sliding downhill is bringing everyone else at this fine institution down. I'm here to create an encyclopedia. You seem to be here to fight with other people and cause disruptions. You're making everyone else's life harder. Please stop that; just go away.\n\nRespectfully,\n \n\nBlanking is considered vandalism. Please refrain.",

They don't take kindly to people that don't share their beliefs. And they are known to have the ability to track people down. And in the translated book of memories, Silent Hill Hiroyuki Owaku stated that Cybil's fate is \"\"left to players' imaginations\"\".\n\nAlso, SH4 revealed that SH2 protagonist James Sunderland disappeared when he went to Silent Hill.

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

Quite the opposite infact - to the uninitiated, 'Death/Murder of Lee Rigby' could refer to any number of incidents/motives/places, whereas most reasonable people would assume '2013 Woolwich attack' refers to some kind of attack in a place called Woolwich that occurred in 2013, which is good enough as a starting point.

    "text": "Disruptive Editing to Ryanair article\n\nThe Ryanair Ciampino meets notability guidelines in WP:AIRCRASH, specificially It is the first or worst accident for a particular airline or airliner. This latest incident involved multiple birdstrike affecting both engines, hard and/or off runway landing causing landing gear collapse, runway blocked and airport closed for 36 hours, 10 people with minor injuries. If there is an incident which caused more damage to an aircraft and disruption to an airport than this then I am not aware of it. \n\nI accept that the Limoges incident resulted in 25 people being taken to hospital (at their own request according to Ryanair) but there is no evidence that their injuries were anything other than minor. Limoges wasn't notable, you lost that argument. \n\nMay I suggest that you take a step back and see what others have to say rather than starting a one man crusade on the matter. 84.9.32.138",

That's just the way it is, and we need to avoid legal action being taken against the foundation. To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15",

Lastly, you clearly didn't understand the God/rock argument so let me try to help.  If you claim the answer is yes, then God has a limit, if the answer is no, then God also has a limit.  Therefore God, or any being for that matter, must have limits of some kind.  Saying he could choose to not be able to implies that he could choose to be capable of it, and therefore one can simply conclude that he is capable of that act.\"",

Secondly, Galilee would not have been exempt, since even virtually autonomous cities like Apamea in Syria were not exempt despite having almost complete self-governance. Thirdly, a Roman edict from G. Vibius Maximus (concerning a similar Roman census) says explicitly that citizens were required to return to their home town, just as it says in the Bible. Fourthly, the same edict says that each man had to bring his entire family with him, just as it says in the Bible.",

As you may have noticed the exact same editor (albeit with a different dynamic IP address from the same ISP) seems to be on a crusade to censor and spam the articles with corporate marketing BS. He/she is undoubtedly an employee of Zap - obvious from the location of the IP address range, the style of the editing, and the fact that the ISP is in the same part of China as Jonway. Perhaps all this evidence is enough to go for semi-protection of all the Zap articles (or at the least the main article and the Zap Alias) to stop this interference and COI/spamming. What do you think?",

Also Christian coalitions have core requirements like acceptance of the Divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, Holy Trinity, Ressurection and Salvation through grace, personal relation to J.C. etc. Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, etc, don't accept all of these. Even the Catholic Church accepts (I believe) certain groups as Christian even if they don't recognize the Pope as long as the fulfill these Christian requirements.

    "text": "February 2007 (UTC)\n\nArmenians got encourge with Russia and France, These countries came and help them. Armenian gangs mostly  were foreign and encouraged the local Armenians. It became a civil war. Armenians and Turkish groups were attacking each other. If you were the decision maker, how would you stop this? Answer is reallocation. The only solution was reallocation. I am not saying old woman and childeren were supposed to immigrate but you can not know who supports Armenians gangs, right?...  'disorganized revenge killings' happened at both side. Ottoman was not strong enough to organize these kind of reallocation.. In fact they were very poor and they had some Armenian causalities during this migration. 19:02, 14",

Had I known of this I would not have requested another admin look after the case.  Jeho, I retracted my statement above; but in the future I would ask that you provide much better clarification for your actions and at least have some kind of discussion or a process of mediation before you throw down the hammer; especially in blocks over 72 hours.

And Trouble Every Day was written in 1965 and released in 1966, years before Rebel Rebel. I guess it could be a coincidence but that seems unlikely. Maybe Bowie heard the Zappa song on the radio & forgot about it, thought he had made it up...\"",

In fact, strange to say, there is primary evidence that after the war, Admiral Hall and von Rintelen were the complete opposite of enemies but close and mutually trusting family friends.

Have you bothered to look this character up in a proper Chinese dictionary? You think the omission of \"\"being unsettled\"\" is intentional do you? \n I feel unable to continue a reasoned discussion when faced with such an attitude. \"\"Uneducated?\"\" \"\"argumentum ad ignorantiam\"\"? Perhaps you need to read up on what argument from ignorance actually means.\n You also don't seem to appreciate the verifiability issue relating to ancient Chinese pronunciations. But you seem to simply refuse to appreciate any point that I raise. So I shall stop trying. Good day.  (Talk) \n\n\"",

Maybe those commmon arguments could be in this article. Like the common view that it is not natural to be gay and therefore it is wrong. And the common answer to this which states that we all do things which are not \"\"natural\"\" every day, like driving a car and using condoms.

To include facts is not promotion, although doing so while leaving out other contradictory facts is biased, and can be considered promotional. So, the correct way to deal with pseudoscience (or any other article for that matter) is to describe the relevant, verifiable facts about the subject, whether positive or negative. \nAs for Lerner being notable, he could be considered notable on two separate subjects, his cosmology work and his fusion work.

It's a bit complicated because the topic includes various ancient empires, the Persian people, Persia, and then Iran (which is a nation that has not existed for very long as it is presently defined).  So for example Timur seems to hve been very brutal, as you state, and yet adopted some Persian customs.  So did slavery under his reign mean there was slavery in Iran?
