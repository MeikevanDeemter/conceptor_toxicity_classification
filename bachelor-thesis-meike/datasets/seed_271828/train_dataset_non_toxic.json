I'm quite tired of this argument, frankly, I've found it's no use putting forward all the logic in the world when adherence to redundant policies is the norm. The link to the BoM page was convincing anough for an admin to change it to Cat 4, however others disagreed on principle, not logic. While it's a shame, I've decided I no longer care whether the public is deceived as to the strength of the cyclone, so long as some of us aren't. As for , I agree with you entirely. Administrators should follow policy and avoid using their power to their advantage in an argument.",

That's just the way it is, and we need to avoid legal action being taken against the foundation. To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15",

For the record, I added the fact that a 76 score on Metacritic constitutes a \"\"Generally Positive\"\" review according to Metacritic's own system.  How is this my \"\"POV.\"\"?  As far as Aaliyah being a featured article, that does not mean you can bully good-faith editors like myself.  There are no rules stating that I cannot make good-faith changes that are well-sourced.  Don't change the subject- answer the question:  Does, or does it not mean \"\"Generally Positive\"\" to have a 76 in Metacritic?  And, if so, why am I not \"\"allowed\"\" to state that?  \"",

Please note that responding to a third opinion does not give my opinion any higher value than those that may have already participated in the discussion. I do not remember any prior interactions with either of the editors involved in this dispute. In this case, I agree with  that the inclusion of said material is inappropriate for an encyclopedia listing. Furthermore, the current version included fails WP:RS and probably constitutes undue weight on top of that. Again, my opinion is of no higher value than any other editor's opinions.\u2014WikiOne \"",

Once upon a time, when Borland was in charge of development, it only developed C++ Builder and Delphi, two separate but highly compatible development tools. They were two language-specific IDEs. I am not sure who came up with the idea of RAD Studio; CodeGear or Embarcadero. But RAD Studio is like Visual Studio today. RAD Studio supports both C++ Builder and Delphi languages. Buying RAD Studio is like buying both Delphi and C++ Builder. Only buying the two separately costs \u20ac11,937.60, while buying only RAD Studio costs \u20ac6,715.20. These prices, of course, do not include subscription costs.\n\nBest regards,",

Similarly, saying her \"\"role in a potential Giuliani administration\"\" and not saying (even in footnote) what was controversial, I think is misleading.  There may be a few other places too.

    "text": "\"\n\n BUSH AND JFK \n\nThe recent 50th anniversary upsurge in Kennedy assasination interest and the imminent releast of classified information in 2017 has caused many conspiracy theories to be re-examined.  More often GHW Bush's name is linked as a conspirator and funder of the conspiracy.  His favoring of Nixon at the time and his oil interests superficially endorse this theory, as does the depth of Nixon's corrupt and dupklicitous influence on those close to him.\n\nI feel the biog needs to highlight this aspect of GHWB's career, especially as both Bush presidents were such avid war-mongers their financial interests must have relied heavily on the \"\"military-industrial\"\" influence that Eisenhower warned the nation against.  Bush's attitudes to war in the middle east directly reflects the false policies which prolonged the Vietnam war.\"",

All they get from the link is vague intimations that somebody, somewhere thinks fighting from the knees is realistic. The other cited article is even less specific.\nIdeally, to cite a myth/misconception you should link to an actual case of someone stating that myth - e.g. an article stating that swords weighed 30 lbs - and then to a rebuttal article, or to an article that gives the source of the misconception as well as a rebuttal. Otherwise the reader has no way of knowing that the articles are actually addressing a real argument, rather than knocking down straw men.",

You can see for yourself that there has never been a consensus at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Hebrew) and Wikipedia:WikiProject Hebrew languages and that therefore Wikipedia respects Hebrew as it is used and spoken by both Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardi Jews, by modern Israelis as Modern Hebrew and as in Biblical Hebrew. Thank you for taking note of this and avoiding any future misunderstanding. If you wish to discuss this matter with more Judaic editors feel free to do so at WP:TALKJUDAISM. Thanks.",
