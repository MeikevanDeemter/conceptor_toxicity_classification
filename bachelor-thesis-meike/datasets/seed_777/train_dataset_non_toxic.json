They don't have to meet Wikipedia's notability requirements. And when the subject becomes notable you'll be able to rename (\"\"move\"\") them to the titles you want. It's an easy way to get around the requirement for notability. So don't worry, you can still write the article on this subject and have it on Wikipedia, just in a different place. I hope that suggestion helps. Best regards  \"",

Somewhere along the way, it devolved into the current goo, of just stuff from 10 years back, not very interesting at all.  When, how, why, did it change?  What happened to the great old Nick@Nite which I used to love?  This article documents the way the old days were, and mentions what the new days are, without giving any story of how it changed from one to the other.  I'm very disappointed.",

If this article isn't a commentary (and POV-driven indictment) on history, then there's the burden to prove that Shariah as practiced today also supports the kinds of restrictions on dhimma that the article claims it to. Sections discussing history should make it clear that their content is historical, and should not contrast events and policies practiced in the 8th or 10th century with standards we accept today. Sections dealing with contemporary usage of dhimma in countries that run under Shariah should make it clear what aspects of the dhimmi system are still being practiced.  \n\n\"",

However I seriously doubt the goal was only to gain a bridgehead, but rather to punch through the Panther Line, which the Soviets clearly failed to do. While the overall campaign was a clear strategic victory for the Soviets because they won the campaign in the end, it was a tactical victory for the Germans because they were successful in holding Narva even though it was not long lasting, i.e. six months.   \"",

The reason isn't very clear.  Was it a presumed copyright violation?  Or a spamming campaign, as your own comment suggested?  Or using Commons as an art gallery?  If the latter, is it only permissible to use Commons for unartistic images?  By the way, I have nothing to do with Horvitz, never met him nor communicated with him, but I admire his work.

As a long-time editor of Wikipedia, I would like to stress that the key to not going crazy here is patience and thick skin. Instead of trying to reinvent Wikipedia, I would encourage you to try changing Wikipedia one small step at a time. It isn't easy, but the results can be very significant. I've had 101 policy and project ideas shot down, but I've also had a small handful that have been successful, and hopefully those small successes have made Wikipedia a better place. By the way, if you really are sick of Wikipedia, you may want to take a look at Veropedia. It's not perfect, but it has some good points (and most of the editors and admins are Wikipedia alum).

Such a judge may wish to help the law evolve by ruling against precedent and thereby indirectly inducing a losing party to appeal. The appeal court will then have an opportunity to review the lower court's decision and may adopt the lower court's reasoning, thereby overturning previous case law.

Or, does confidentiality prevent him from forwarding that mail to another admin to get a second opinion?  \n\nI suppose there is no perfect way to fix this without a written policy, and that would be instruction creep.  Individual admins could create their own caveats. I hope they don't pick the version chosen by LessHeard because we should be able to be more sympathetic than that.",

I noticed a strange phenomenon in Russia: over all, the birth rates ARE growing (12.1 in 2008 vs 12.4 in 2009; 11.5 in 2007 vs 12.1 in 2008), at the end of each of those years, they went down slightly (12.5 -> 12.4 in 2009, for example). I'll have to research this more to really see why this is. But if I had to say now, I'd say it is because of the New Year and Orthodox Christmas (as well as Muslim Kurban Bairam) celebrations. November, December, January is when everyone is celebrating and partying. Not a lot of people are conceiving during this time.",

That prerogative writs could be sent to Britain's colonies was used in arguing for the right of habeas corpus in Guantanamo Bay.  Otherwise the English courts considered Virginia outside their jurisdiction and accepted the independence of local courts.  Obviously a country cannot possess another country unless it has executive, legislative and judicial power over it.  Would you say that the Virginia was a part of England?

All categories sit in a nested structure which , if followed upwards, will always end with [[Category:Main topic classifications]] (I have surrounded this category with nowiki tags to avoid this discussion being categorised). To create an appropriate category, the simplest way is to go to the best relevant higher level category such as Category:American Singers and then works downwards through that until you reach a level where individual singers are listed. That is probably the place to create your new category. I can't promise that even then it will stick - that is up to the views of other editors. Hope that this helps.

I'm afraid I missed the earlier section on Margate's page, my mistake. However, \"\"duplication\"\" apart, am wondering about your reasoning of \"\"vague/dubious\"\" as these criteria are ones I have seen on any number of non-league club pages or why the section was not deleted after the earlier addition of Barry Thornley (not by me!) which created it (the section)? On the Tonbridge page I am wondering at what level captaincy would be valid, as once again this criteria appears on numerous pages. Thanks for any info.. Regards.   \"",

Absolute determinism is equivalent to history dependence (the entire chain of events leading to 'this event') as opposed to a stochastic process that has the Markov property (is memoryless,  depending only upon the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it), describing a Markov chain. If so, this may be the 'root of all evil' so to say. QM depends on probability distributions. The even more restrictive Markov chains can be used in QM as a way to compute (example http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0764). The problem is discreteness vs continuity: Markov chains are discrete but QM has a continuous time evolution, and therein lies conflict.

    "text": "Yet Another Sock Puppetery Accusation Against Me\nYou may remember I wrote to you yesterday about closing my account because of annoying editors. Here's why.\n\nUser:Aervanath has filed a sock puppet accusation against me on behalf of user:Mountolive. The sock puppets he/she accuses me of using are user:Bluee Mountain and user:Warrington. I find this strange because had anybody bothered to check the IP addresses of the accounts in question he/she would readily see I'm not guilty. Why hasn't anybody done that? Also, The report seems to be filed on Mountolive's talk page. This seems very odd to me. So, I have two questions: How do I encourage somebody to check the IP addresses? And where do I post my official response?",

Further research has refuted that claim, and nanodiamonds are not delivered in situ, they are created in the impact. In fact further research has concluded that the nanodiamonds are a mix of cubic, hexagonal, new previously unknown polymorphs and always accompanied by a mix of carbon sheet polymorphs, that transition nearly continuously to nanodiamond. The Madden found nanodiamonds in the sediments in Oklahoma, and completely independent secondary result that you insisted on deleting from the reference list. Now Kennett finds nanodiamond at half the sites, and studies them extensively. This has moved well beyond the primary into the tertiary.   \n\nGet a life.

The questions now become: is the material supported by the reference, is the reference WP:MEDRS, and is the material worthy of inclusion? A previous arguement about including similar XMRV material in the main Chronic Fatigue Syndrome article was that with all the publicity of the studies, readers would expect some coverage in the WP article. It would seem a difficult question that will have to be reached by editor consensus. Perhaps an RFC to draw some more editors in would be in order?",

I myself have long resigned myself to the fact that my questions won't be answered, since you don't have them. You're new here, I'll give you that, but I don't think I'll be pandering to some teenager's ego. I feel free to post here and ask as I wish. If you're given to shedding tears about how everyone is mean to you, that's your problem. Now go and read something edifying - Psych[ology|pathy] 101 perhaps. All the best",
