I have no objection to them being there, and it serves as a useful reference that later on I can look and say \"\"Oh yes, that's right. Ariem told me such-and-such\"\", without needing to hunt through the page history for deleted comments. You can obviously do whatever you want with my comment here, but I'd prefer anything on my page to stay there.\n\nMore importantly, do we actually have a name here or there which could be googled or wiki'd in order to confirm that there are indeed real bands in the video?  10:40, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)\"",

I was just wondering about procedures around dealing with persistent spammers. I've been watching penetration test, computer forensics and PCI DSS for a while now, and they've been plagued by linkspamming, particularly penetration test, which has repeatedly had its content shaved down and links inserted into it. Anyway, this all comes from one IP address, and it ties back to the company which the links are pointing to. Can anything be done about this? It seems harsh to ban them entirely - I can't even guarantee the user knows how to look at the talk page associated with his/her IP address. Any thoughts? \n(Also, I note that my attempt to copy the warning stuff into his talk page a few weeks ago was a bit clumsy.)",

I have researched this person on the internet and it appears that the claim is made that she was a Coast Guardsman at one time or another, but no details as to time period or duty stations is given. The web page I viewed was rather self-serving and I am not sure what purpose it served.  As far as I am concerned the person in question is non notable, and I will remove further attempts to place the name in the list of notable Coast Guardsmen until a Wikipedia article is created by that title and reasons are given for its inclusion in Wikipedia as a notable person.",

Furthermore, secondary sources are more likely to be published \u2013 the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. It helps us avoid original research. One of the biggest problems with Wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions, whether intentionally or not, which would be considered original research.
