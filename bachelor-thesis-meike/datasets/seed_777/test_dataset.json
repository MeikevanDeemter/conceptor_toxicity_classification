Looking at Wikipedia:Linking_to_other_wikis, GTW's policies match up pretty well with Wikipedias, although we allow mention of speculation (rumours etc) where it is clearly marked as such; GTW is specific and relevant; and it is edited daily by several editors (increasingly so). I just believe a link would help readers access relevant information about the topic, as well as other items such as media including screenshots of the GTA IV trailer and partial transcriptions (quotes) from the GI article.

We've already had this debate for every other city around Australia - the Sydney article of course refers to the Sydney metropolitan area, not just the City of Sydney area; in the same way the Newcastle article should refer to the whole area, not just the LGA.
