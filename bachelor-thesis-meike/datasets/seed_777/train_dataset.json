He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

Maybe you need to do your research and quit trying to bash people you don't know off. I suggest you run along, before you get yourself in trouble, inferior.",

She is fat, has greasy hair, a really round face, flabby cheeks and does this really weird thing with her chin, she is a proper girl dog.

You are nothing but a pathetic sheep, which does not surprise me coming from a Wikipedia mongrel.  You care more about the status quo than about the truth, and for that, you are scum.",

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

They don't have to meet Wikipedia's notability requirements. And when the subject becomes notable you'll be able to rename (\"\"move\"\") them to the titles you want. It's an easy way to get around the requirement for notability. So don't worry, you can still write the article on this subject and have it on Wikipedia, just in a different place.

I think if you wish to write articles about fictional characters, it would be a good idea to review some of the Wikipedia guidelines for notability, such as Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)#Elements of fiction. And check out some of the articles about notable anime/manga characters already included in Wikipedia, such as Usagi Tsukino and Belldandy.

Instead of trying to reinvent Wikipedia, I would encourage you to try changing Wikipedia one small step at a time. It isn't easy, but the results can be very significant. I've had 101 policy and project ideas shot down, but I've also had a small handful that have been successful, and hopefully those small successes have made Wikipedia a better place. By the way, if you really are sick of Wikipedia, you may want to take a look at Veropedia. It's not perfect, but it has some good points (and most of the editors and admins are Wikipedia alum).

A judge (or even an interim appeal court) may rule against a precedent that is outdated. The judge may feel the decision needs to be overturned due to more sophisticated legal reasoning. Such a judge may wish to help the law evolve by ruling against precedent and thereby indirectly inducing a losing party to appeal. The appeal court will then have an opportunity to review the lower court's decision and may adopt the lower court's reasoning, thereby overturning previous case law. This may also happen several times as the case works its way through intermediate appellate jurisdictions.\n\nWould it be an idea to provide an example?

You do this by adding a {{GFDL}} or {{PD}} tag  in your image description. Without information the image will be deleted soon.\n\nIn addition its useful to upload pictures to commons:Special:Upload so that we from the german wikipedia can also use it.

In any case, every turkish politician is within the kemalistic ideology... since noone criticising or rejecting or judging this ideology, but they all accept it. Taksim can as well have this link. The Megali Idea was not that simple as establishing a Greek state that covers all the Greeks, as u said... The Greeks of Pontus, Southern Italy, former southern Serbia (modern FYROM), Eastern Rumelia, Alexandria, Cyprus, where excluded. Yes, Megali Idea shares similarities with Enosis, that's why the link is present in that article. but adding Megali Idea and excluding Kemalistic Ideology from Taksim, seems, at least weird, cause Kemalism is much more relevant with Taksim than Megali Idea could ever be.

Let's face it, the fields of molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics all share  a considerable amount overlap, and report on this fact here, as opposed to needlessly pigeon-holing biochemists.\"",

Personally, I think the two beliefs sections should be one and all of this information should be in, but the consensus is otherwise.

I looked at your track map, and it feels my eye gets drawn to the green tropical storm dots too much there too.  Also, the contrast between Category 1 through 2 might be increased some, it's hard to tell the difference, though white vs. yellow is fine.  Category-5 red looks good on your map, but as a background behind text it makes things harder to read, so a lighter shade of red or pink might be better.  Maybe grey, white, aqua, white, yellow, orange, pink-ish?  Thanks for reading! -^",

All categories sit in a nested structure which , if followed upwards, will always end with [[Category:Main topic classifications]] (I have surrounded this category with nowiki tags to avoid this discussion being categorised). To create an appropriate category, the simplest way is to go to the best relevant higher level category such as Category:American Singers and then works downwards through that until you reach a level where individual singers are listed. That is probably the place to create your new category. I can't promise that even then it will stick - that is up to the views of other editors. Hope that this helps.

If so, this may be the 'root of all evil' so to say. QM depends on probability distributions. The even more restrictive Markov chains can be used in QM as a way to compute (example http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0764).

Nobody would say that. If everybody works hard the question would be why there so not sufficient output in the economy. Just flawed. \n\n\"",

On numerous occasions in class teachers expressed overtly or implicitly their dissatisfaction with her principalship. My advice to kids there now is not to get too frustrated and if your teachers and school aren't providing much support, to look for other ways of getting/doing what you want.",

Instead of scouring the net for that one silly article that will drop the emo buzzword in reference to a band that has nothing to do with it (that's what is going on in some cases), shouldn't this be relying on more of a consensus for whether or not a band is emo? You may find one article to call AFI emo, but for every one of those, you can find hundreds that wouldn't dare throw them into that. That doesn't mean the consensus is right 100% of the time, but there's something wrong with the idea of trying to find one person dumb enough to call a band emo so they can be included on some list.",
