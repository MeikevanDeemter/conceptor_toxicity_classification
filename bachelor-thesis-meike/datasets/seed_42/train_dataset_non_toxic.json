Early on the Army decided that it was cost-prohibitive to maintain whole herds, so they used the remount stations to house selected stallions and then contracted out with local horse breeders to provide mares. Robinson was the main headquarters once the Remount Service really got organized (after World War I), but as Montanabw pointed out the majority of the actual stations were in the West. One thing the remount service is credited with (as it was only in operation on a large scale for about 20-25 years) was an overall improvement of the quality of horses in civilian service. This was because the Army didn't (and couldn't) buy all the animals produced by the program and the breeders were allowed to keep those that didn't meet standards or were otherwise unneeded.",

As for making the judgment, I'm merely laying out the way I see this discussion as having gone, and requesting the move & close as per what the consensus is after a very long discussion period.",

The high level of musical proficiency is often combined with a lyrical counterpart in the form of epic textual concepts, resulting in lengthy songs and concept albums. As a result of these factors, progressive metal is rarely heard on mainstream radio and video programs, much due to that the length of the songs are not suited for those medias.\"\"\n\nKamelot meets most of those requirements, to deny that they are prog is to deny them what they are.  \n\n\"",

Hence it's Kiev not Kyiv etc. As far as I can make out, English speakers and particularly the media, overwhelmingly use the term Prime Minister, including: CNN,the BBC, Tony Blair's official website etc. I don't want to start an edit-war, but we should be reflecting the world here, not trying to shape it!\n\nOh, and my move of the Prime Minister of Spain page was a somewhat late revert, not a move. The issue was never discussed fully on that page, and even the talk on Zapatero's page came to no real consensus. Cheers \u2014  \"",

I just spent about an hour composing a detailed reply to a seemingly unexceptionable Science Refdesk query about frogs and toads (which had already had one routine but brief answer from regular contributor Kainaw), only to find that when I Save Paged, the whole question disappeared. As far as I can tell from History (which I'm not very conversant with so forgive me if I'm mistaken) you were 'reverting a banned user.' I'm sure you had a good reason for the action, but for my own curiosity:\nwas the banned user the OP?\ncan you link me to the reason for the ban?\nwhat tipped you off given the innocuousness of the query, and\nis there a handy list of banned users I should check before answering apparently innocent queries to avoid future wastes of time? 87.81.230.195",

Astrology entails the belief that celestial events, alignments, angles, etc., correlate with earthly affairs in ways that are not obviously causal, e.g., it being dark because the Sun has set. Using the constellations to know when to gather eggs, for instance, is a far cry from a Western astrologer consulting an individual's nativity to see when s/he will get married. It really isn't a tradition of astrology in this sense as it isn't as organized and conceptual, although if the astrological tendencies are there it may be relevant for Category:Astrology, and perhaps even an article rename.",

Notability, from Wikipedia's perspective, is not about how the subject (Knok) is written about in Wikipedia; and it's not about how widely it's known by word of mouth; it's solely about what has been written about the subject in other sources such as the news. For an organization like knok, the relevant guideline is WP:ORG. I urge you to read it. Cheers, and whatever happens to the Knok article I hope you continue to contribute to the encyclopedia.",

The web page of the National Federation of Cypriots says it represents 300,000 Cypriots living in the UK. This does not mean that there are only 300,000 Cypriots living in the UK. It means that the people it represents, which are mainly Greek Cypriot community organisations number 300,000. It presumably added up the numbers of its member organisations and came to that figure, which is almost overwhelmingly composed of Greek Cypriots since the National Federation of Cypriots has barley any Turkish Cypriot members.",

Darwin, Weismann and Wiedersheim (who is credited with coining the term 'vestigial' to refer to them) all used it in this way right from the beginning, in the 19th century. So it isn't a redefinition of the term to match a discovery of function, it has always meant this. Hope this helps, but I suspect you will still disagree.",

The source that you've used (the strategy written by McCaffrey) is okay, but it would be very good if you would also mention some third-party source that discusses or describes the strategy. In the lingo of Wikipedia, I think the strategy itself is called a primary source, but Wikipedia generally prefers secondary sources.  I can look for secondary sources for this if you'd like.  Also, perhaps a bit more concise?  For example, I don't think it's really significant that McCaffrey \"\"recognized that illegal drugs remain widely available\"\", which is common knowledge.

This is my opinion about your country and these are also facts.  You once were part of the Ottoman Empire, you have big Turkish minority in the eastern part of the country, every part of Greece uses some specific dialect of the greek language and you are claiming the ownership of the name Macedonia. About the Macedonian language: this language is recognized as official in our country and it is different from any other language in the world.  That fact is recognized by many relevant international linguistic institutions. I can assure you have many friends in Macedonia that simply don't understand Bulgarian at all. Simply, Macedonian language is not a dialect of Bulgarian no matter how much you are truing to repeat that hoping that it will become true.",

In April 2003 a Netherlands-based academic institution, Heidelberg Appeal the Netherlands, examined the judgment. It found that there were 27 accusations against Lomborg, of which only two minor ones might be justified. Meanwhile, Lomborg had lodged a formal complaint against the Danish Committee, and in December the Danish government overturned the committee's ruling. UCS is also no recognised academic body.
