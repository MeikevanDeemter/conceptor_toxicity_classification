He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Ch\u00e1vez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

Robinson was the main headquarters once the Remount Service really got organized (after World War I), but as Montanabw pointed out the majority of the actual stations were in the West. One thing the remount service is credited with (as it was only in operation on a large scale for about 20-25 years) was an overall improvement of the quality of horses in civilian service. This was because the Army didn't (and couldn't) buy all the animals produced by the program and the breeders were allowed to keep those that didn't meet standards or were otherwise unneeded.",

It could be reduced to one, or two short sentences that state that there have been and still are historical, cultural and religious practices that involve circumcision - but without going into detail.  This is a medical article, and the use of circumcision as an initiation ritual is a different subject to medical circumcision.  Only where medical circumcision has itself become part of cultural practice should there be a focus on that manifestation of circumcision as cultural practice.",

Think of Kashmir in 1900: There were Hindus and Muslims living with one another. There were no wars being fought. Then, after the partion, which created nations, there suddenly was a militancy problem. Same exact scenario in Israel. Thus, these insurgencies or resistances or whatever you want to call them can not be claimed to be Islamic, when these two regions clearly had Islamic culture and Muslims from hundreds of years prior without terrorists.\"",

    "text": "\"\nKC9TV, I think a more productive suggestion to de-escalate things would be for you to refrain from using the word \"\"hoax.\"\" You have asserted that your understanding of the word does not imply malice; realize that that is very different from other editors' understanding of the term. Read the lede sentence of hoax. You seem to want to debate semantics in the parsing of \"\"deliberate\"\" there; the commonly accepted understanding is a deliberate attempt to include disinformation while aware that the information is falsehood. Whether you realize it or not (and personally I think you do and are merely trying to ruffle his feathers), you're accusing Kintetsbuffalo of bad faith. If you stop saying that Kintetsbuffalo is trying to introduce a hoax in the encyclopedia, I'm pretty sure that this can be discussed rationally.   \"",

As for proof that people have been defining 'vestigial' with still being able to have some functions (that could have been worded better) since the theory  began, take a look at the sources I added to the Vestigial structures article. Darwin, Weismann and Wiedersheim (who is credited with coining the term 'vestigial' to refer to them) all used it in this way right from the beginning, in the 19th century. So it isn't a redefinition of the term to match a discovery of function, it has always meant this. Hope this helps, but I suspect you will still disagree.",
