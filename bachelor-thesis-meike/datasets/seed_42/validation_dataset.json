I do have one minor critique to make, though... I noticed that you promoted Italian Renaissance to featured status, but at the time, I had an actionable (and in my view appropriate) objection. (Candidate page, with my comments) I objected to elevation to featured status on the grounds that there are stylistic issues in the article, missing commas, etc. I went through the first half, but haven't had time to fix the second half. At any rate, you probably just didn't see my objection; I'll do more to address it myself, but the style isn't up to par for our (rightly) high standards for featured articles.  talk \n\n==",

The warning that you 'dittoed' was for vandalism that I didn't commit (the person who did it had cracked the key to my wireless network, which was weak, and I had to change it). Second, as far as the alleged 'discussion on the talk page' is concerned, I see no such thing. What are you talking about? If it is in the archives, it is not an ongoing discussion, and that comment about tags by Supreme Deliciousness did not even receive one response. Tourism in the West Bank belongs in the Tourism in the Palestinian territories article. Who is arguing whether or not the West Bank is part of Israel? Most maps don't show it as part of Israel, either.96.26.213.146",
