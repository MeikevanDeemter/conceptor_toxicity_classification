I'd like to write an Op-Ed exploring this way of thinking about Wikipedia's various neighborhoods and communities. The Op-Ed would also argue that Wikipedians need to institute some form of urban renewal for the myriad dead and dying projects. I thought about running this idea as a special for the WikiProject Report, but since it would be mostly my opinion and the theory could be applied to more than just WikiProjects, I feel it would be more appropriate to run it as an opinion piece separate from the WikiProject Report. Would you be game for that?",

In fact, claiming it is not a Ponzi Scheme seems to be an opinion in itself.
