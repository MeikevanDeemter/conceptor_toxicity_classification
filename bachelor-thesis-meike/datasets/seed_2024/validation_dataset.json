Perhaps the problem can be best summarized by your own comment on this page when you said that you thought about the issue and came to agree with the rest of the group. In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance, your actions were shameful. When faced with a group of people who reached consensus, you still had the audacity to have the page locked to reflect your (poorly reasoned) point of view. These are the actions of a stubborn child who wants his way and completely contradictory to what Wikipedia is about. I think you should grow up, recognize that your positions are often incorrect, and defer to the democratic process. Seriously, why do you think your opinion is so important that your beliefs should outweigh a consensus?  \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.13.207.186   \"",

Sinn Fein and the IRA, the left wingers and Catholic, were against it and viewed Collins as a traitor.  The Civil War resulted.  The IRA assassinated him.  The treaty allowed the British to still subjugate the Irish.  Lloyd George and Winston Churchill were ecstatic.  Eamon de Valera and Sinn Fein were not.  They wanted a Republic and to be rid of the British entirely.  The British and the Irish Protestants are still big Collins' fans.

I noticed you had added the names of team members of several state championship sports teams at North Scott High School to an article about the same. While that is a very nice addition, I have removed it because the athletes mentioned \u2014 while nice people, I'm sure \u2014 are simply not notable. Thousands of high school athletes participate on state championship teams, but never participate in collegiate or professional sports; their only time in the spotlight is when they are on the trophy stand. \n\n's advice is well stated: You may want to review the notability guidelines for biographies, and particularly the section on athletes and then consider whether their names are notable enough to include in Wikipedia articles.

You are all way to triggerhappy with your so-called 'fair' judgements on users you have never really checked the backgrounds on. THAT is insulting enough by itself. Especially considering how it started. I never started it. Look it up if you want.
