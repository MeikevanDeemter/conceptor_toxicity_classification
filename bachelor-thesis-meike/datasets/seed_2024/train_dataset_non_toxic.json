Watchful waiting may be the best choice for an older man who has a higher risk of dying from something other than his prostate cancer.\n\nUsually, tumors that have grown beyond the edge of the prostate can't be cured with either radiation or surgery.

In 1963, John McCarthy wrote a seminal paper A basis for a mathematical theory of computation found In Computer Programming and formal systems. North-Holland. McCarthy's paper is a bridge from what we have today and the Church, Turing, Kleene work. McCarthy's basic argument was that recursive functions were the natural setting.

As a long-time editor of Wikipedia, I would like to stress that the key to not going crazy here is patience and thick skin. Instead of trying to reinvent Wikipedia, I would encourage you to try changing Wikipedia one small step at a time. It isn't easy, but the results can be very significant. I've had 101 policy and project ideas shot down, but I've also had a small handful that have been successful, and hopefully those small successes have made Wikipedia a better place. By the way, if you really are sick of Wikipedia, you may want to take a look at Veropedia. It's not perfect, but it has some good points (and most of the editors and admins are Wikipedia alum).

Consensus at Glock 19 was against inclusion of such a link, while opinions were pretty evenly divided at Walther P22.  At a mediation cabal request for the P22 article, an editor pointed out that this article has a similar link and suggested that the link was inappropriate.  What say the editors of this article?",

Instead, what we have here is a selection of quotes meant to push a certain arguement, that being that Hamas does not recognize Israel. There are two options which can be taken to make this section NPOV. The article needs to be rewritten or expanded such that it accurately graps ALL of the Charter, with references not only to its policies towards Israel, but its social and economic policies and ambitions as well. Since the majority of Hamas' efforts are directed to domestic efforts and not terrorist activities, those aspects of its charter should not be shoved aside. The other option of course is to provide the link to the charter which can easily be read by anyone remotely interested in the document. I'd opt for the second, since a comprehensive and NPOV summary of the charter would consume alot of space, despite not being really necessary in an encyclopedic entry.",

In my experience with runescape the game is also overloaded with people using macro's to level/gain items to sell for gp, as well as accounts. Jagex has attempted and recently added an update that they say will ban all people who real life trade. I would think in an online game as popular as KO that they would be able to prevent duping. They know the code they can't be so unknowning of the game they wrote to prevent the cheats from being availiable. \nAlso this article should include information on the experience leveling system, such as how much exp it takes to level. Not just that there is not enough information on the p2p pay to play cost, and I think that would be a good addition to this page as well.",

I have also watched the investigation from Turkish Airlines flight 1951 where Gordon Bethune (a former VP at Boeing) states that the pilots main job is to fly the airplane & they must never forget it never mind what a computer says.\n\nAs the pilots have survived this crash,they should be able to tell the investigators a great deal about what happened.

I'm glad about that.\nI wanted to ask if you're interested in becoming an adopted user. Adopt-a-User is a program designed to help new or inexperienced editors. You can for example ask your adopter any questions you have. An important part of the Adopt-a-User program is talking to each other, and wanting to ask questions and learning about the ways of Wikipedia. In that spirit, I would ask you to consider not removing this message. Instead, just put your reply, your thoughts, or whatever is on your mind beneath it. A very important part of contributing to Wikipedia is communication, and that encompasses replying to messages and leaving them on your talk page for a while.Cheers, Amalthea \"",

For the matter, this has raised enough concerns in France for the story to be also mentioned on a major radio, Europe 1 . This is why, I believe the better way to calm things out is to go for the conservative option which is to use the same image in the English version than the one used in the French version. An image which is a good consensus as it does show the Eiffel Tower, the undisputed symbol of the city, but also its urban surrounding landscape and its full dimension as a metropolis.

Its design would indicate it cannot climb stairs and there is no footage of the robot climbing stairs on youtube. It may well be that the robot can climb scale stairs of about an inch high, but this is not made clear and the implication is that the robot can climb domestic stairs.

You listed them all as belonging to the Cape Ducato class, however that is a class of only 5 ships.

Those links should be put in the article of the laws of the particular country, not here. Second, the page is not indended to be a repository of useful law links. So just because it was useful useful site does not warrant inclusion. Rather, a link should aid in the understanding of the content of the article, most of them did not.

Even so, though, it's not like Rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time. In other words, it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements, some of which led to temporary schisms, but to my understanding Justinian's system, even if not everybody liked it, became a practical reality (one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed Rome further and further away).",
