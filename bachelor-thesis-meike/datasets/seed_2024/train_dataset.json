Was he given an incomplete score by Schubert and was waiting for the rest before saying anything? If so, he waited in vain throughout the six remaining years of Schubert's life. After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't H\u00fcttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died? Could personality factors like introvertedness or jealousy have been at play here?",

They do not allow any form of freedom of speech and immediately suppress anything they do not like or anything they cannot be bothered to research. One could also draw lines that Brookie is very akin to Adolph Hitler in the way that he is ever-vigilant and despises anyone that is below him in the Wikipedia hierarchy. If Brookie or anybody else chooses to delete this then it is proof that Wikipedia does not allow anyone to voice their opinion and will only stregthen the argument that Wikipedia is the second phase of the Nazi's plot for world domination.",

He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Ch\u00e1vez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.\n\nI find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health!

When that act was passed, Good Friday and Christmas Day were already established as days of rest and Christian Worship and thus did not neet to be included in the Act.  Although there have been two additions to the Bank Holidays (New year's day and May Day) and two other changes (Whit Monday became fixed and August Bank holiday was moved to the end of August), Good Friday and Christmas day are still excluded.

In this approach, no treatment is given until the tumor gets bigger. Watchful waiting may be the best choice for an older man who has a higher risk of dying from something other than his prostate cancer.\n\nUsually, tumors that have grown beyond the edge of the prostate can't be cured with either radiation or surgery. They can be treated with hormones that slow the cancer's growth.\"",

It's also name by which still the city is known in English world, although the fact probably will change in the future. Therefore it's reasonable to mention both names\n3) There is no such case, i believe, with Frauenburg. It's small city so there is no point in making alternative name too.",

Rousseff was never a member of the VPR. At that time - 1968 - she was a member of another organization called COLINA. She would later join VAR Palmares in 1969. Therefore, there are absolutely no links, whatsoever, between Rousseff and the assassination of Charles Chandler.",

As a long-time editor of Wikipedia, I would like to stress that the key to not going crazy here is patience and thick skin. Instead of trying to reinvent Wikipedia, I would encourage you to try changing Wikipedia one small step at a time. It isn't easy, but the results can be very significant. I've had 101 policy and project ideas shot down, but I've also had a small handful that have been successful, and hopefully those small successes have made Wikipedia a better place. By the way, if you really are sick of Wikipedia, you may want to take a look at Veropedia. It's not perfect, but it has some good points (and most of the editors and admins are Wikipedia alum). Anyway, good luck with whatever you decide to do!",

Such disruption may include (but is not limited to) changing other users' signed comments, making deliberately misleading edits, harassment, excessive personal attacks, and inserting material that may be defamatory. Users will normally be warned before they are blocked.\n\nSysops may also block new user accounts that make lots of disruptive edits. Reincarnations of blocked disruptive users are likely to be re-blocked, particularly if they edit in a way that suggests they are likely to continue being disruptive.\n\n...I violated.

The article needs to be rewritten or expanded such that it accurately graps ALL of the Charter, with references not only to its policies towards Israel, but its social and economic policies and ambitions as well. Since the majority of Hamas' efforts are directed to domestic efforts and not terrorist activities, those aspects of its charter should not be shoved aside. The other option of course is to provide the link to the charter which can easily be read by anyone remotely interested in the document.

Post your concerns about these obvious lies of omission at that ANI thread, and if you don't get any answers, complain to arbcom - they have final authority over admins who so clearly abuse their positions to protect their friends, or indeed themselves. His high and mighty attitude to so called troll socks has only one real goal - it helps him justify his naked attempts to control what people find out about him. Some people call that a conflict of interest, some people would describe such admin actions as a violation of WP:INVOLVED. He doesn't, of course.   \"",

You only have one weapon, your suit, which is equipped wit ha hand shot, and a list of combo moves. Your main goal in each level is to get to a certain area, and/or destroy a certain objective. However, destroying enemies faster, without being hit, yields a higher combat point bonus, which is used to buy things like continues, or different suits.

For the matter, this has raised enough concerns in France for the story to be also mentioned on a major radio, Europe 1 . This is why, I believe the better way to calm things out is to go for the conservative option which is to use the same image in the English version than the one used in the French version. An image which is a good consensus as it does show the Eiffel Tower, the undisputed symbol of the city, but also its urban surrounding landscape and its full dimension as a metropolis.

A quick internet search reveals that sellers and promoters of the Spykee robot often casually mention its stair climbing ability, but user forums by people that have bought the robot clearly state it does not climb stairs. Its design would indicate it cannot climb stairs and there is no footage of the robot climbing stairs on youtube. It may well be that the robot can climb scale stairs of about an inch high, but this is not made clear and the implication is that the robot can climb domestic stairs.

I don't see any evidence of that trust here, and so I'm not surprised that argument wasn't successful.   \nNow that we've moved from persuasion to determining where the consensus lies, no, it is not appropriate to disregard an opinion because an editor considers the edit in question to be minor.

In fact, the only reason Kurt and Rachel have non-free images is because of the fact that their wardrobe can at times define their characters and a free image wouldn't represent that as well. The promotional image you uploaded only shows him with a fancy tie and regular dress, which would be equivalent to one that was deleted previously. The image could easily be substituted with one of the free images of Chris Colfer at the Wikipedia Commons, whereas the screenshot is depicting a fancy coat, tie, etc. that Kurt is regularly seen in.

I do see what that user is saying, I think we should include something about how there are different views about Puerto Rico's actual political situation, but how to say it, without sounding subjective to one POV?\nAnyway, I was looking at that user's other edits and all of them deal with the independece movement in Puerto Rico, an in all of them he changes small things that sound pro-independence.  He talks about the macheteros as a political movement more than a paramilitary movement, for example.  Well, I had my first wiki-controversy, hehe.

In any case, the Philistines themselves were not present yet in the land in the year 4,000 BC - they arrived around the time of the Israelites/Jews, and they settled mostly in a relatively small strip along the coast, an area which is partly the Gaza strip.

Even so, though, it's not like Rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time. In other words, it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements, some of which led to temporary schisms, but to my understanding Justinian's system, even if not everybody liked it, became a practical reality (one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed Rome further and further away).",
